<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Colver lectureship is provided by a
fund of $10,000 presented to the University
by Mr. and Mrs. Jesse L. Rosenberger
of Chicago in memory of Mrs. Rosenberger&#8217;s
father, Charles K. Colver of the class of 1842.
The following sentences from the letter accompanying
the gift explain the purposes of
the foundation:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;It is desired that, so far as possible, for
these lectures only subjects of particular importance
and lecturers eminent in scholarship
or of other marked qualifications shall be
chosen. It is desired that the lectures shall
be distinctive and valuable contributions to
human knowledge, known for their quality
rather than their number. Income, or portions
of income, not used for lectures may be used
for the publication of any of the lectures
deemed desirable to be so published.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charles Kendrick Colver (1821-1896) was
a graduate of Brown University of the class
of 1842. The necrologist of the University
wrote of him: &#8220;He was distinguished for his
broad and accurate scholarship, his unswerving
personal integrity, championship of truth, and
obedience to God in his daily life. He was
severely simple and unworldly in character.&#8221;</p>

THE EARLIEST UNIVERSITIES</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Universities</span>, like cathedrals and parliaments,
are a product of the Middle
Ages. The Greeks and the Romans,
strange as it may seem, had no universities
in the sense in which the word has
been used for the past seven or eight centuries.
They had higher education, but
the terms are not synonymous. Much of
their instruction in law, rhetoric, and philosophy
it would be hard to surpass, but
it was not organized into the form of permanent
institutions of learning. A great
teacher like Socrates gave no diplomas;
if a modern student sat at his feet for
three months, he would demand a certificate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
something tangible and external
to show for it&mdash;an excellent theme, by
the way, for a Socratic dialogue. Only in
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries do
there emerge in the world those features
of organized education with which we are
most familiar, all that machinery of instruction
represented by faculties and colleges
and courses of study, examinations
and commencements and academic degrees.
In all these matters we are the
heirs and successors, not of Athens and
Alexandria, but of Paris and Bologna.</p>

<p>The contrast between these earliest
universities and those of today is of course
broad and striking. Throughout the period
of its origins the mediaeval university
had no libraries, laboratories, or museums,
no endowment or buildings of its
own; it could not possibly have met the requirements
of the Carnegie Foundation!
As an historical textbook from one of the
youngest of American universities tells
us, with an unconscious touch of local
color, it had &#8220;none of the attributes of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
material existence which with us are so
self-evident.&#8221; The mediaeval university
was, in the fine old phrase of Pasquier,
&#8220;built of men&#8221;&mdash;<i>b&acirc;tie en hommes</i>. Such
a university had no board of trustees and
published no catalogue; it had no student
societies&mdash;except so far as the university
itself was fundamentally a society of students&mdash;no
college journalism, no dramatics,
no athletics, none of those &#8220;outside
activities&#8221; which are the chief excuse
for inside inactivity in the American
college.</p>

<p>And yet, great as these differences are,
the fact remains that the university of the
twentieth century is the lineal descendant
of mediaeval Paris and Bologna. They
are the rock whence we were hewn, the
hole of the pit whence we were digged.
The fundamental organization is the
same, the historic continuity is unbroken.
They created the university tradition of
the modern world, that common tradition
which belongs to all our institutions of
higher learning, the newest as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
oldest, and which all college and university
men should know and cherish. The
origin and nature of these earliest universities
is the subject of these three lectures.
The first will deal with university
institutions, the second with university instruction,
the third with the life of university
students.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In recent years the early history of
universities has begun to attract the serious
attention of historical scholars, and
mediaeval institutions of learning have at
last been lifted out of the region of myth
and fable where they long lay obscured.
We now know that the foundation of the
University of Oxford was not one of the
many virtues which the millennial celebration
could properly ascribe to King
Alfred; that Bologna did not go back to
the Emperor Theodosius; that the University
of Paris did not exist in the time
of Charlemagne, or for nearly four centuries
afterward. It is hard, even for
the modern world, to realize that many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
things had no founder or fixed date of
beginning but instead &#8220;just grew,&#8221; arising
slowly and silently without definite
record. This explains why, in spite of all
the researches of Father Denifle and
Dean Rashdall and the local antiquaries,
the beginnings of the oldest universities
are obscure and often uncertain, so that
we must content ourselves sometimes with
very general statements.</p>

<p>The occasion for the rise of universities
was a great revival of learning, not that
revival of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries to which the term is usually applied,
but an earlier revival, less known
though in its way quite as significant,
which historians now call the renaissance
of the twelfth century. So long as knowledge
was limited to the seven liberal arts
of the early Middle Ages, there could be
no universities, for there was nothing to
teach beyond the bare elements of grammar,
rhetoric, logic, and the still barer notions
of arithmetic, astronomy, geometry,
and music, which did duty for an academic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
curriculum. Between 1100 and 1200,
however, there came a great influx of new
knowledge into western Europe, partly
through Italy and Sicily, but chiefly
through the Arab scholars of Spain&mdash;the
works of Aristotle, Euclid, Ptolemy,
and the Greek physicians, the new arithmetic,
and those texts of the Roman law
which had lain hidden through the Dark
Ages. In addition to the elementary
propositions of triangle and circle, Europe
now had those books of plane and solid
geometry which have done duty in schools
and colleges ever since; instead of the
painful operations with Roman numerals&mdash;how
painful one can readily see by
trying a simple problem of multiplication
or division with these characters&mdash;it
was now possible to work readily with
Arabic figures; in the place of Boethius
the &#8220;Master of them that know&#8221; became
the teacher of Europe in logic, metaphysics,
and ethics. In law and medicine
men now possessed the fulness of ancient
learning. This new knowledge burst the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
bonds of the cathedral and monastery
schools and created the learned professions;
it drew over mountains and across
the narrow seas eager youths who, like
Chaucer&#8217;s Oxford clerk of a later day,
&#8216;would gladly learn and gladly teach,&#8217;
to form in Paris and Bologna those academic
gilds which have given us our first
and our best definition of a university, a
society of masters and scholars.</p>

<p>To this general statement concerning
the twelfth century there is one partial
exception, the medical university of Salerno.
Here, a day&#8217;s journey to the south
of Naples, in territory at first Lombard
and later Norman, but still in close contact
with the Greek East, a school of medicine
had existed as early as the middle
of the eleventh century, and for perhaps
two hundred years thereafter it was the
most renowned medical centre in Europe.
In this &#8220;city of Hippocrates&#8221; the medical
writings of the ancient Greeks were
expounded and even developed on the
side of anatomy and surgery, while its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
teachings were condensed into pithy maxims
of hygiene which have not yet lost
their vogue&mdash;&#8220;after dinner walk a
mile,&#8221; etc. Of the academic organization
of Salerno we know nothing before 1231,
and when in this year the standardizing
hand of Frederick II regulated its degrees
Salerno had already been distanced
by newer universities farther north. Important
in the history of medicine, it had
no influence on the growth of university
institutions.</p>

<p>If the University of Salerno is older
in time, that of Bologna has a much larger
place in the development of higher education.
And while Salerno was known only
as a school of medicine, Bologna was a
many-sided institution, though most noteworthy
as the centre of the revival of the
Roman law. Contrary to a common impression,
the Roman law did not disappear
from the West in the early Middle
Ages, but its influence was greatly diminished
as a result of the Germanic invasions.
Side by side with the Germanic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
codes, Roman law survived as the customary
law of the Roman population,
known no longer through the great law
books of Justinian but in elementary
manuals and form-books which grew
thinner and more jejune as time went on.
The <i>Digest</i>, the most important part of
the <i>Corpus Juris Civilis</i>, disappears from
view between 603 and 1076; only two
manuscripts survived; in Maitland&#8217;s
phrase, it &#8220;barely escaped with its life.&#8221;
Legal study persisted, if at all, merely as
an apprenticeship in the drafting of documents,
a form of applied rhetoric.
Then, late in the eleventh century, and
closely connected with the revival of trade
and town life, came a revival of law, foreshadowing
the renaissance of the century
which followed. This revival can be
traced at more than one point in Italy,
perhaps not first at Bologna, but here it
soon found its centre for the geographical
reasons which, then as now, made this
city the meeting-point of the chief routes
of communication in northern Italy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
Some time before 1100 we hear of a professor
named Pepo, &#8220;the bright and shining
light of Bologna&#8221;; by 1119 we meet
with the phrase <i>Bononia docta</i>. At Bologna,
as at Paris, a great teacher stands
at the beginning of university development.
The teacher who gave Bologna its
reputation was one Irnerius, perhaps the
most famous of the many great professors
of law in the Middle Ages. Just what he
wrote and what he taught are still subjects
of dispute among scholars, but he seems to
have fixed the method of &#8216;glossing&#8217; the
law texts upon the basis of a comprehensive
use of the whole <i>Corpus Juris</i>, as
contrasted with the meagre epitomes of
the preceding centuries, fully and finally
separating the Roman law from rhetoric
and establishing it firmly as a subject of
professional study. Then, about 1140,
Gratian, a monk of San Felice, composed
the <i>Decretum</i> which became
the standard text in canon law, thus
marked off from theology as a distinct
subject of higher study; and the pre&euml;minence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
of Bologna as a law school was
fully assured.</p>

<p>A student class had now appeared, expressing
itself in correspondence and in
poetry, and by 1158 it was sufficiently
important in Italy to receive a formal
grant of rights and privileges from Emperor
Frederick Barbarossa, though no
particular town or university is mentioned.
By this time Bologna had become
the resort of some hundreds of students,
not only from Italy but from
beyond the Alps. Far from home and
undefended, they united for mutual protection
and assistance, and this organization
of foreign, or Transmontane, students
was the beginning of the university.
In this union they seem to have followed
the example of the gilds already common
in Italian cities. Indeed, the word university
means originally such a group or
corporation in general, and only in
time did it come to be limited to gilds
of masters and students, <i>universitas
societas magistrorum discipulorumque</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
Historically, the word university has no
connection with the universe or the universality
of learning; it denotes only the
totality of a group, whether of barbers,
carpenters, or students did not
matter. The students of Bologna organized
such a university first as a means of
protection against the townspeople, for
the price of rooms and necessaries rose
rapidly with the crowd of new tenants
and consumers, and the individual student
was helpless against such profiteering.
United, the students could bring
the town to terms by the threat of
departure as a body, secession, for the
university, having no buildings, was free
to move, and there are many historic examples
of such migrations. Better rent
one&#8217;s rooms for less than not rent them at
all, and so the student organizations
secured the power to fix the prices of
lodgings and books through their representatives.</p>

<p>Victorious over the townsmen, the students
turned on &#8216;their other enemies, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
professors.&#8217; Here the threat was a collective
boycott, and as the masters lived
at first wholly from the fees of their pupils,
this threat was equally effective. The
professor was put under bond to live up
to a minute set of regulations which guaranteed
his students the worth of the
money paid by each. We read in the
earliest statutes (1317) that a professor
might not be absent without leave, even a
single day, and if he desired to leave town
he had to make a deposit to ensure his
return. If he failed to secure an audience
of five for a regular lecture, he was
fined as if absent&mdash;a poor lecture indeed
which could not secure five hearers! He
must begin with the bell and quit within
one minute after the next bell. He was
not allowed to skip a chapter in his commentary,
or postpone a difficulty to the
end of the hour, and he was obliged to
cover ground systematically, so much in
each specific term of the year. No one
might spend the whole year on introduction
and bibliography! Coercion of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
sort presupposes an effective organization
of the student body, and we hear of two
and even four universities of students,
each composed of &#8216;nations&#8217; and presided
over by a rector. Emphatically Bologna
was a student university, and Italian students
are still quite apt to demand a voice
in university affairs. When I first visited
the University of Palermo I found it
just recovering from a riot in which the
students had broken the front windows
in a demand for more frequent, and thus
less comprehensive, examinations. At
Padua&#8217;s seventh centenary last May the
students practically took over the town,
with a programme of processions and ceremonies
quite their own and an amount
of noise and tumult which almost broke
up the most solemn occasions and did
break the windows of the greatest hall in
the city.</p>

<p>Excluded from the &#8216;universities&#8217; of
students, the professors also formed a gild
or &#8216;college,&#8217; requiring for admission thereto
certain qualifications which were ascertained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
by examination, so that no student
could enter save by the gild&#8217;s consent.
And, inasmuch as ability to teach a subject
is a good test of knowing it, the
student came to seek the professor&#8217;s license
as a certificate of attainment, regardless
of his future career. This certificate, the
license to teach (<i>licentia docendi</i>), thus
became the earliest form of academic
degree. Our higher degrees still preserve
this tradition in the words master
(<i>magister</i>) and doctor, originally synonymous,
while the French even have a
<i>licence</i>. A Master of Arts was one qualified
to teach the liberal arts; a Doctor of
Laws, a certified teacher of law. And the
ambitious student sought the degree and
gave an inaugural lecture, even when he
expressly disclaimed all intention of continuing
in the teaching profession.
Already we recognize at Bologna the
standard academic degrees as well as the
university organization and well-known
officials like the rector.</p>

<p>Other subjects of study appeared in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
course of time, arts, medicine, and theology,
but Bologna was pre&euml;minently a
school of civil law, and as such it became
the model of university organization for
Italy, Spain, and southern France, countries
where the study of law has always
had political and social as well as merely
academic significance. Some of these universities
became Bologna&#8217;s competitors,
like Montpellier and Orleans as well as
the Italian schools nearer home. Frederick
II founded the University of
Naples in 1224 so that the students of his
Sicilian kingdom could go to a Ghibelline
school at home instead of the Guelfic centre
in the North. Rival Padua was
founded two years earlier as a secession
from Bologna, and only last year, on the
occasion of Padua&#8217;s seven-hundredth anniversary,
I saw the ancient feud healed
by the kiss of peace bestowed on Bologna&#8217;s
rector amid the encores of ten thousand
spectators. Padua, however, scarcely
equalled Bologna in our period, even
though at a later age Portia sent thither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
for legal authority, and though the university
still shines with the glory of
Galileo.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In northern Europe the origin of universities
must be sought at Paris, in the
cathedral school of Notre-Dame. By the
beginning of the twelfth century in
France and the Low Countries learning
was no longer confined to monasteries but
had its most active centres in the schools
attached to cathedrals, of which the most
famous were those of Li&egrave;ge, Rheims,
Laon, Paris, Orleans, and Chartres. The
most notable of these schools of the liberal
arts was probably Chartres, distinguished
by a canonist like St. Ives and by famous
teachers of classics and philosophy like
Bernard and Thierry. As early as 991
a monk of Rheims, Richer, describes the
hardships of his journey to Chartres in
order to study the <i>Aphorisms</i> of Hippocrates
of Cos; while from the twelfth century
John of Salisbury, the leading northern
humanist of the age, has left us an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
account of the masters which we shall
later have occasion to cite. Nowhere else
today can we drop back more easily into a
cathedral city of the twelfth century, the
peaceful town still dominated by its
church and sharing, now as then,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent9">the minster&#8217;s vast repose.</div>
<div class="verse">Silent and gray as forest-leaguered cliff</div>
<div class="verse">Left inland by the ocean&#8217;s slow retreat,</div>
<div class="indent9">... patiently remote</div>
<div class="verse">From the great tides of life it breasted once,</div>
<div class="verse">Hearing the noise of men as in a dream.</div>
</div></div>

<p>By the time the cathedral stood complete,
with its &#8220;dedicated shapes of saints and
kings,&#8221; it had ceased to be an intellectual
centre of the first importance, over-shadowed
by Paris fifty-odd miles away,
so that Chartres never became a university.</p>

<p>The advantages of Paris were partly
geographical, partly political as the capital
of the new French monarchy, but
something must be set down to the influence
of a great teacher in the person of
Abelard. This brilliant young radical,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
with his persistent questioning and his
scant respect for titled authority, drew
students in large numbers wherever he
taught, whether at Paris or in the wilderness.
At Paris he was connected with the
church of Mont-Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve longer
than with the cathedral school, but resort
to Paris became a habit in his time, and
in this way he had a significant influence
on the rise of the university. In an institutional
sense the university was a direct
outgrowth of the school of Notre-Dame,
whose chancellor alone had authority to
license teaching in the diocese and thus
kept his control over the granting of university
degrees, which here as at Bologna
were originally teachers&#8217; certificates. The
early schools were within the cathedral
precincts on the Ile de la Cit&eacute;, that tangled
quarter about Notre-Dame pictured
by Victor Hugo which has long since
been demolished. A little later we find
masters and scholars living on the Little
Bridge (Petit-Pont) which connected the
island with the Left Bank of the Seine&mdash;this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
bridge gave its name to a whole school
of philosophers, the Parvipontani&mdash;but
by the thirteenth century they have over-run
the Left Bank, thenceforth the Latin
Quarter of Paris.</p>

<p>At what date Paris ceased to be a cathedral
school and became a university,
no one can say, though it was certainly before
the end of the twelfth century. Universities,
however, like to have precise
dates to celebrate, and the University of
Paris has chosen 1200, the year of its first
royal charter. In that year, after certain
students had been killed in a town and
gown altercation, King Philip Augustus
issued a formal privilege which punished
his pr&eacute;v&ocirc;t and recognized the exemption
of the students and their servants from
lay jurisdiction, thus creating that special
position of students before the courts
which has not yet wholly disappeared
from the world&#8217;s practice, though generally
from its law. More specific was the
first papal privilege, the bull <i>Parens scientiarum</i>
of 1231, issued after a two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
years&#8217; cessation of lectures growing out
of a riot in which a band of students, having
found &#8220;wine that was good and sweet
to drink,&#8221; beat up the tavern keeper and
his friends till they in turn suffered from
the pr&eacute;v&ocirc;t and his men, a dissension in
which the thirteenth century clearly saw
the hand of the devil. Confirming the
existing exemptions, the Pope goes on to
regulate the discretion of the chancellor
in conferring the license, at the same time
that he recognizes the right of the masters
and students &#8220;to make constitutions and
ordinances regulating the manner and
time of lectures and disputations, the
costume to be worn,&#8221; attendance at masters&#8217;
funerals, the lectures of bachelors,
necessarily more limited than those of
fully fledged masters, the price of lodgings,
and the coercion of members. Students
must not carry arms, and only those
who frequent the schools regularly are to
enjoy the exemptions of students, the
interpretation in practice being attendance
at not less than two lectures a week.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>While the word university does not appear
in these documents, it is taken for
granted. A university in the sense of an
organized body of masters existed already
in the twelfth century; by 1231 it had developed
into a corporation, for Paris, in
contrast to Bologna, was a university of
masters. There were now four faculties,
each under a dean: arts, canon law (civil
law was forbidden at Paris after 1219),
medicine, and theology. The masters of
arts, much more numerous than the
others, were grouped into four &#8216;nations:&#8217;
the French, including the Latin
peoples; the Norman; the Picard, including
also the Low Countries; and the
English, comprising England, Germany,
and the North and East of Europe.
These four nations chose the head of the
university, the rector, as he is still generally
styled on the Continent, whose term,
however, was short, being later only three
months. If we may judge from such
minutes as have survived, much of the
time of the nations was devoted to consuming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
the fees collected from new members
and new officers, or, as it was called,
drinking up the surplus&mdash;at the Two
Swords near the Petit-Pont, at the sign
of Our Lady in the Rue S.-Jacques, at
the Swan, the Falcon, the Arms of
France, and scores of similar places. A
learned monograph on the taverns of mediaeval
Paris has been written from the
records of the English nation alone. The
artificial constitution of the nations seems
to have encouraged rather than diminished
the feuds and rivalries between the
various regions represented at Paris, of
which Jacques de Vitry has left a classic
description:<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;They wrangled and disputed not
merely about the various sects or about
some discussions; but the differences between
the countries also caused dissensions,
hatreds, and virulent animosities
among them, and they impudently uttered
all kinds of affronts and insults<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
against one another. They affirmed that
the English were drunkards and had tails;
the sons of France proud, effeminate, and
carefully adorned like women. They
said that the Germans were furious and
obscene at their feasts; the Normans, vain
and boastful; the Poitevins, traitors and
always adventurers. The Burgundians
they considered vulgar and stupid. The
Bretons were reputed to be fickle and
changeable, and were often reproached
for the death of Arthur. The Lombards
were called avaricious, vicious, and cowardly;
the Romans, seditious, turbulent,
and slanderous; the Sicilians, tyrannical
and cruel; the inhabitants of Brabant,
men of blood, incendiaries, brigands, and
ravishers; the Flemish, fickle, prodigal,
gluttonous, yielding as butter, and
slothful. After such insults, from words
they often came to blows.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another university institution which
goes back to twelfth-century Paris is the
college. Originally merely an endowed
hospice or hall of residence, the college<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
early became an established unit of academic
life at many universities. &#8220;The
object of the earliest college-founders was
simply to secure board and lodging for
poor scholars who could not pay for it
themselves;&#8221; but in course of time the
colleges became normal centres of life and
teaching, absorbing into themselves much
of the activity of the university. The colleges
had buildings and endowments, if
the university had not. There was a college
at Paris as early as 1180; there were
sixty-eight by 1500, and the system survived
until the Revolution, to leave behind
it only fragments of buildings or
local names like the Sorbonne of today,
sole memento of that Coll&egrave;ge de la Sorbonne
founded for theologians by a confessor
of St. Louis in the thirteenth century.
Many other continental universities
had their colleges, one of which, the
ancient College of Spain at Bologna, still
survives for the delectation of the few
Spanish youths who reach its quiet courtyard.
But of course the ultimate home of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the college was Oxford and Cambridge,
where it came to be the most characteristic
feature of university life, arrogating
to itself practically all teaching as well as
direction of social life, until the university
became merely an examining and degree-conferring
body. Here the older
colleges like Balliol, Merton, and Peterhouse
date from the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Paris was pre&euml;minent in the Middle
Ages as a school of theology, and, as theology
was the supreme subject of mediaeval
study, &#8220;Madame la haute science&#8221;
it was called, this means that it was
pre&euml;minent as a university. &#8220;The Italians
have the Papacy, the Germans have
the Empire, and the French have Learning,&#8221;
ran the old saying; and the chosen
abode of learning was Paris. Quite naturally
Paris became the source and the
model for northern universities. Oxford
branched off from this parent stem late
in the twelfth century, likewise with no
definite date of foundation; Cambridge
began somewhat later. The German universities,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
none of them older than the
fourteenth century, were confessed imitations
of Paris. Thus the Elector Palatine,
Ruprecht, in founding the University
of Heidelberg in 1386&mdash;for these
later universities were founded at specific
dates&mdash;provides that it &#8220;shall be ruled,
disposed, and regulated according to the
modes and matters accustomed to be observed
in the University of Paris, and
that as a handmaid of Paris&mdash;a worthy
one let us hope&mdash;it shall imitate the steps
of Paris in every way possible, so that
there shall be four faculties,&#8221; four nations
and a rector, exemptions for students
and their servants, and even caps
and gowns for the several faculties &#8220;as
has been observed at Paris.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>By the end of the Middle Ages at least
eighty universities had been founded in
different parts of Europe.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Some of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
these were short-lived, many were of only
local importance, others like Salerno
flourished only to die, but some like Paris
and Montpellier, Bologna and Padua,
Oxford and Cambridge, Vienna and
Prague and Leipzig, Coimbra and Salamanca,
Cracow and Louvain, have an
unbroken history of many centuries of
distinction. And the great European universities
of more recent foundation, like
Berlin, Strasbourg, Edinburgh, Manchester,
and London, follow in their organization
the ancient models. In America
the earliest institutions of higher learning
reproduced the type of the contemporary
English college at a time when the
university in England was eclipsed by
its constituent colleges; but in the creation
of universities in the later nineteenth
century, America turned to the universities
of the Continent and thus entered
once more into the ancient inheritance.
Even in the colonial period a sense of the
general university tradition survived, for
the charter of Rhode Island College in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
1764 grants &#8220;the same privileges, dignities,
and immunities enjoyed by the
American colleges, and European universities.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What then is our inheritance from the
oldest of universities? In the first place
it is not buildings or a type of architecture,
for the early universities had no
buildings of their own, but on occasion
used private halls and neighboring
churches. After all, as late as 1775 the
First Baptist Church in Providence was
built &#8220;for the publick worship of Almighty
God, and also for holding Commencement
in&#8221;! Indeed one who seeks
to reconstruct the life of ancient universities
will find little aid in their existing
remains. Salerno retains no monuments
of its university, though its rare old cathedral,
where Hildebrand lies buried, must
have seen the passing of many generations
of would-be physicians. In the halls
and coats of arms of &#8220;many-domed
Padua proud&#8221; we behold the Renaissance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
not the Middle Ages. Even Bologna,
<i>Bononia docta</i>, with its leaning
towers and cool arcades, has no remains
of university architecture earlier than the
fourteenth century, from which date the
oldest monuments of its professors of law
gathered now into the municipal museum.
Montpellier and Orleans preserve nothing
from this period. Paris, too often
careless of its storied past, can show today
only the ancient church of Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre,
where university meetings
were often held, unless we count, as
we should, the great cathedral in the Cit&eacute;
whence the university originally sprang.
The oldest Cambridge college, Peterhouse,
has only a fragment of its earliest
buildings; the finest Cambridge monument,
King&#8217;s College chapel, is of the late
fifteenth century. More than all others
Oxford gives the deepest impression of
continuity with an ancient past, Matthew
Arnold&#8217;s Oxford, &#8220;so venerable, so
lovely ... steeped in sentiment as she
lies, spreading her gardens to the moon-light,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
and whispering from her towers the
last enchantments of the Middle Age;&#8221;
yet so far as the actual college buildings
are concerned they have much more of
sentiment than of the Middle Ages. Only
at Merton, which fixed the college type
at Oxford, do any of the present structures
carry us back of 1300, and nowhere
is there much of the fourteenth century.
Those venerable glories of Oxford, the
Bodleian library, the tower of Magdalen,
and the hall of Christ Church, belong to
a much later age, the period of the Tudors,
and thus by ordinary reckoning to
modern times. When we say how very
mediaeval, we often mean how very
Tudor!</p>

<p>Neither does the continuity lie in academic
form and ceremony, in spite of occasional
survivals, like the conferring of
degrees by the ring or the kiss of peace,
or the timing of examinations by the hour
glass as I have seen it at Portuguese
Coimbra. Academic costume has in it
some element of tradition where it is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
daily dress as at Oxford, Cambridge, and
Coimbra, but in America the tradition
was broken by our ancestors, and the
formal cap and gown current in the
United States today are a product of
modern Albany rather than of mediaeval
Paris and Bologna. Even in their ancient
homes the costumes have changed. &#8220;It
is probable,&#8221; says Rashdall, &#8220;that no
gown now worn in Oxford has much resemblance
to its mediaeval ancestor.&#8221; A
student of mediaeval Padua would not
recognize the variegated procession which
wound through its streets last summer;
Robert de Sorbon would rub his eyes at
the non-mediaeval styles of the gorgeous
gowns which were massed on the stage of
the great hall of the Sorbonne when President
Wilson received his honorary degree
in 1918.</p>

<p>It is, then, in institutions that the university
tradition is most direct. First, the
very name university, as an association of
masters and scholars leading the common
life of learning. Characteristic of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
Middle Ages as such a corporation is,
the individualistic modern world has
found nothing to take its place. Next,
the notion of a curriculum of study, definitely
laid down as regards time and subjects,
tested by an examination and leading
to a degree, as well as many of the
degrees themselves&mdash;bachelor, as a stage
toward the mastership, master, doctor, in
arts, law, medicine, and theology. Then
the faculties, four or more, with their
deans, and the higher officers such as chancellors
and rectors, not to mention the
college, wherever the residential college
still survives. The essentials of university
organization are clear and unmistakable,
and they have been handed down in unbroken
continuity. They have lasted
more than seven hundred years&mdash;what
form of government has lasted so long?
Very likely all this is not final&mdash;nothing
is in this world of flux&mdash;but it is singularly
tough and persistent, suited to use
and also to abuse, like Bryce&#8217;s university
with a faculty &#8220;consisting of Mrs. Johnson<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
and myself,&#8221; or the &#8220;eleven leading
universities&#8221; of a certain state of the
Middle West! Universities are at times
criticised for their aloofness or their devotion
to vocationalism, for being too
easy or too severe, and drastic efforts have
been made to reform them by abolishing
entrance requirements or eliminating all
that does not lead directly to bread and
butter; but no substitute has been found
for the university in its main business,
the training of scholars and the maintenance
of the tradition of learning and investigation.
The glory of the mediaeval
university, says Rashdall, was &#8220;the consecration
of Learning,&#8221; and the glory and
the vision have not yet perished from the
earth. &#8220;The mediaeval university,&#8221; it
has been said, &#8220;was the school of the modern
spirit.&#8221; How the early universities
performed this task will be the theme of
the next lecture.</p>

THE MEDIAEVAL PROFESSOR</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the last lecture we considered the
mediaeval university as an institution.
We come now to examine it as an intellectual
centre. This involves some account
of its course of study, its methods
of teaching, and the status and freedom
of its teachers. The element of continuity,
so clear in institutions, is often less
evident in the content of learning, but
even here the thread is unbroken, the contrast
with modern conditions less sharp
than is often supposed.</p>

<p>The basis of education in the early
Middle Ages consisted, as we have seen, of
the so-called seven liberal arts. Three of
these, grammar, rhetoric, and logic, were
grouped as the trivium; the remaining
four, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy,
and music, made up the quadrivium. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
first group was the more rudimentary,
but the second was rudimentary enough.
The number was fixed and the content
standardized during the decadence of ancient
learning, and the whole conception
reached the Middle Ages chiefly in the
book of a certain Martianus Capella,
written in the early fifth century. These
later ages of classical antiquity, in condensing
and desiccating knowledge for
their own more limited intelligence, were
also unconsciously preparing for later
times those small and convenient packages
which alone could be carried as a
<i>viaticum</i> through the stormy times of the
Dark Ages. It was almost wholly as
formulated in a few standard texts that
the learning of the ancient world was
transmitted to mediaeval times, and the
authority of these manuals was so great
that a list of those in use in any period affords
an accurate index of the extent of
its knowledge and the nature of its instruction.
It was a bookish age, with
great reverence for standard authorities,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
and its instruction followed closely the
written word.</p>

<p>In the monastic and cathedral schools of
the earlier period the textbooks were few
and simple, chiefly the Latin grammars
of Donatus and Priscian with some elementary
reading-books, the logical manuals
of Boethius, as well as his arithmetic
and music, a manual of rhetoric, the most
elementary propositions of geometry, and
an outline of practical astronomy such as
that of the Venerable Bede. Of Greek,
of course, there was none. This slender
curriculum in arts was much enlarged by
the renaissance of the twelfth century,
which added to the store of western
knowledge the astronomy of Ptolemy,
the complete works of Euclid, and the
Aristotelian logic, while at the same time
under the head of grammar great stimulus
was given to the study and reading of
the Latin classics. This classical revival,
which is noteworthy and comparatively
little known, centred in such cathedral
schools as Chartres and Orleans, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the spirit of a real humanism showed itself
in an enthusiastic study of ancient
authors and in the production of Latin
verse of a really remarkable quality. Certain
writings of one of these poets, Bishop
Hildebert of Le Mans, were even mistaken
for &#8220;real antiques&#8221; by later humanists.
Nevertheless, though brilliant,
this classical movement was short-lived,
crushed in its early youth by the triumph
of logic and the more practical studies of
law and rhetoric. In the later twelfth
century John of Salisbury inveighs
against the logicians of his day, with their
superficial knowledge of literature; in the
university curriculum of the thirteenth
century, literary studies have quite disappeared.
Toward 1250, when a French
poet, Henri d&#8217;Andeli, wrote his <i>Battle of
the Seven Arts</i>, the classics are already
the ancients, fighting a losing battle
against the moderns:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">Logic has the students,</div>
<div class="verse">Whereas Grammar is reduced in numbers.</div>
<div class="verse"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#183; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#183; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#183; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#183; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#183; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#183; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#183; </div>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
<div class="verse">Civil Law rode gorgeously</div>
<div class="verse">And Canon Law rode haughtily</div>
<div class="verse">Ahead of all the other arts.</div>
</div></div>

<p>If the absence of the ancient classics
and of vernacular literature is a striking
feature of the university curriculum in
arts, an equally striking fact is the
amount of emphasis placed on logic or
dialectic. The earliest university statutes,
those of Paris in 1215, require the
whole of Aristotle&#8217;s logical works, and
throughout the Middle Ages these remain
the backbone of the arts course, so that
Chaucer can speak of the study of logic
as synonymous with attendance at a university&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">That un-to logik hadde longe y-go.</p>

<p>In a sense this is perfectly just, for logic
was not only a major subject of study itself,
it pervaded every other subject as a
method and gave tone and character to
the mediaeval mind. Syllogism, disputation,
the orderly marshalling of arguments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
for and against specific theses,
these became the intellectual habit of the
age in law and medicine as well as in philosophy
and theology. The logic, of
course, was Aristotle&#8217;s, and the other
works of the philosopher soon followed,
so that in the Paris course of 1254 we find
also the <i>Ethics</i>, the <i>Metaphysics</i>, and the
various treatises on natural science which
had at first been forbidden to students.
To Dante Aristotle had become &#8220;the
Master of them that know,&#8221; by virtue of
the universality of his method no less than
of his all-embracing learning. &#8220;The
father of book knowledge and the grandfather
of the commentator,&#8221; no other
writer appealed so strongly as Aristotle
to the mediaeval reverence for the textbook
and the mediaeval habit of formal
thought. Doctrines like the eternity of
matter which seemed dangerous to faith
were explained away, and great and authoritative
systems of theology were built
up by the methods of the pagan philosopher.
And all idea of literary form disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
when everything depended on
argument alone.</p>

<p>If the study of the classics became confined
to examples and excerpts designed to
illustrate the rules of grammar, rhetoric
had a somewhat different fate by reason
of its practical applications. The intellectual
life of the Middle Ages was not
characterized by spontaneous or widely
diffused power of literary expression.
Few were able to write, still fewer could
compose a letter, and the professional
scribes and notaries on whom devolved
the greater part of the labor of mediaeval
correspondence fastened upon the letter-writing
of the period the stereotyped
formalism of a conventional rhetoric.
Regular instruction in the composition of
letters and official acts was given in the
schools and chanceries, and numerous
professors, called <i>dictatores</i>, went about
from place to place teaching this valuable
art&mdash;&#8220;often and exceeding necessary
for the clergy, for monks suitable, and for
laymen honorable,&#8221; as one rhetorician<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
tells us. By the thirteenth century such
masters had found a place in certain universities,
especially in Italy and Southern
France, and they advertised their wares
in a way that has been compared to the
claims of a modern business course&mdash;short
and practical, with no time wasted
on outgrown classical authors but everything
fresh and snappy and up-to-date,
ready to be applied the same day if need
be! Thus one professor at Bologna derides
the study of Cicero, whom he cannot
recall having read, and promises to train
his students in writing every sort of letter
and official document which was demanded
of the notaries and secretaries of
his day. Since, as we shall see in the next
lecture, such teachers specialized in the
composition of student letters, chiefly skilful
appeals to the parental purse, their
practical utility was at once apparent.
&#8220;Let us,&#8221; says one writer, &#8220;take as our
theme today that a poor and diligent student
at Paris is to write his mother for
necessary expenses.&#8221; Would not every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
listener be sure that here at least he had
found &#8220;the real thing&#8221;? The professor
of rhetoric might also be called in to draft
a university prospectus, like the circular
issued in 1229 by the masters of the new
University of Toulouse setting forth its
superiority to Paris&mdash;theologians teaching
in the pulpits and preaching at the
street corners, lawyers magnifying Justinian
and physicians Galen, professors of
grammar and logic, and musicians with
their organs, lectures on the books of natural
philosophy then forbidden at Paris,
low prices, a friendly populace, the way
now prepared by the extirpation of the
thorns of heresy, a land flowing with milk
and honey, Bacchus reigning in the vineyards
and Ceres in the fields under the
mild climate desired by the philosophers
of old, with plenary indulgence for all
masters and students. Who could resist
such an appeal from the South?</p>

<p>With grammar and rhetoric reduced to
a subordinate position and the studies of
the quadrivium receiving but scant attention,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
the arts course was mainly a
course in logic and philosophy, plus so
much of the natural sciences as could be
apprehended by the scholastic study of
the &#8220;natural books&#8221; of Aristotle. Laboratories
there were none until long after
the Middle Ages were past, and of history
and the social sciences nothing was heard
in universities until still later. Hard,
close drill on a few well-thumbed books
was the rule. The course in arts led normally
to the master&#8217;s degree in six years,
with the baccalaureate somewhere on the
way. Graduation in arts was the common
preparation for professional study, being
regularly required for theology and
usual for intending lawyers and physicians.
A sound tradition, to which the
American world has given too little attention!</p>

<p>Contrary to a common impression,
there were relatively few students of theology
in mediaeval universities, for a
prescribed theological training for the
priesthood came in only with the Counter-Reformation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
The requirements for admission
were high; the course in theology
itself was long; the books were costly.
True, these books were commonly only
the Bible and the <i>Sentences</i> of Peter
Lombard, but the Bible in the Middle
Ages might run into several volumes,
especially when accompanied by gloss and
commentary, and the copying of these by
hand was a tedious and costly business.
An ambitious student at Orleans who asks
for money to buy a Bible and begin
theology is advised by his father to turn
rather to some lucrative profession. At
the best, complain the Paris chancellors,
students come late to theology, which
should be the wife of their youth.</p>

<p>Medicine likewise was studied in books,
chiefly Galen and Hippocrates with their
Arabic translators and commentators,
among whom Avicenna held the first
place after the thirteenth century. Indeed
Avicenna was still more firmly intrenched
in the East, for as late as 1887
a majority of the native physicians in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Persian capital &#8220;knew no medicine but
that of Avicenna.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Except for some
advance in anatomy and surgery at certain
southern schools, like Bologna and
Montpellier, the mediaeval universities
made no contributions to medical knowledge,
for no subject was less adapted to
their prevailing method of verbal and
syllogistic dogmatism.</p>

<p>In law the basis of all instruction was
inevitably the <i>Corpus Juris Civilis</i> of
Justinian, for the customary law of mediaeval
Europe was never a subject of university
study. The central book was the
<i>Digest</i>, summarizing the ripest fruits of
Roman legal science, and it was their
mastery of the <i>Digest</i> that gives pre&euml;minence
to the mediaeval civilians. They
brought the resources of the whole <i>Corpus</i>
to bear on each passage in an elaborate
gloss, and they showed refinement and
subtlety of legal thought analogous to
that of the scholastic philosophers. After
all, &#8220;law is a form of scholasticism.&#8221; But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
whereas the scholastic method in philosophy
has lost hold on much of the modern
world, the work of the glossators still
survives. &#8220;In many respects,&#8221; says Rashdall,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
&#8220;the work of the School of Bologna
represents the most brilliant achievement
of the intellect of mediaeval Europe.
The mediaeval mind had, indeed, a certain
natural affinity for the study and development
of an already existing body of
Law. The limitations of its knowledge
of the past and of the material Universe
were not, to any appreciable extent, a bar
to the mastery of a Science which concerns
itself simply with the business and
the relations of every-day life. The Jurist
received his Justinian on authority as the
Theologian received the Canonical and
Patristic writings, or the Philosopher his
Aristotle, while he had the advantage of
receiving it in the original language. It
had only to be understood, to be interpreted,
developed, and applied.... The
works of these men are, perhaps, the only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
productions of mediaeval learning to
which the modern Professor of any science
whatever may turn, not merely for
the sake of their historical interest, not
merely in the hope of finding ideas of a
suggestive value, but with some possibility
of finding a solution of the doubts,
difficulties and problems which still beset
the modern student.&#8221;</p>

<p>The canon law was closely associated
with the civil, indeed for many purposes
it was desirable to graduate in both these
subjects as a <i>Doctor utriusque juris</i>, or
as we say a J.U.D. or an LL. D. Canon
law was condemned by the theologians as
a &#8220;lucrative&#8221; subject, which drew students
away from pure learning toward
the path of ecclesiastical preferment. By
the thirteenth century the mediaeval
church was a vast administrative machine
which needed lawyers to run it, and a
well-trained canonist had a good chance
of rising to the highest dignities.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> No<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
wonder canon law attracted the ambitious,
the wealthy, even the idle, for at Paris
we are told that the lazy students frequented
the lectures of the canonists in
the middle of the morning, rather than
the other courses which began at six. The
standard textbook in canon law was the
<i>Decretum</i> of Gratian, supplemented by
the decretals of subsequent popes, especially
the great collection which Gregory
IX in 1234 distributed to the principal
universities. The methods of studying
these texts were the same as in the civil
law, giving rise to the rich canonistic literature
of the later Middle Ages and the
marginal glosses for which, according to
Dante, &#8220;the Gospel and the great doctors
are deserted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of the textbooks needed in all these
subjects the university undertook to secure
a supply at once sufficient, correct,
and cheap, for the regulation of the book
trade was one of the earliest and most
valued of university privileges. As books
were costly they were commonly rented,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
at a fixed price per quire, rather than
owned; indeed the sale of books was
hedged in by close restrictions designed
to curb monopoly prices and to prevent
their removal from town. The earliest
Paris tariff, ca. 1286, lists for rent copies
of one hundred and thirty-eight different
books. In course of time many students
came to have books of their own&mdash;a
Bible, or at least some part of it, a piece
of the <i>Digest</i>, perhaps even the &#8220;twenty
bokes clad in blak or reed&#8221; of Chaucer&#8217;s
Oxford clerk. Whether rented or owned,
the supply was not inconsiderable; on the
Bolognese monuments each student has
a book before him. So long as each copy
had to be made by hand, accuracy was a
matter of much importance, and the university
had its supervisors and correctors
who inspected periodically all the books
for sale in the town. Moreover, at Bologna
a constant supply of new books was
secured by the requirement that every
professor should turn over a copy of his
repetitions and disputations to the stationers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
for publication. The principal books
of law and theology were the natural
outgrowth of university lectures. With
demand and supply so largely concentrated
in the universities, it is not surprising
that these should have become the
chief centres of the book trade and, as
we should say, of the publishing business.
So long as students could rent the books
they required, there was less need for libraries
than we might at first suppose,
and it was quite natural that for long the
university as such should have no library.
In course of time, however, books were
given for the use of students, chiefly in
the form of bequests to the colleges, where
they could be borrowed or consulted on
the spot. By 1338 the oldest extant catalogue
of the Sorbonne, the chief Paris
library, lists 1722 volumes, many of them
still to be seen in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale,
while many an Oxford college
still preserves codices which belonged to
its library in the Middle Ages.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>Turning from books to professors, we
should note at the outset that the Middle
Ages produced many excellent and renowned
teachers. The mechanism of
learning was still comparatively simple,
its content not yet overwhelming, and, in
spite of the close adherence to texts, there
was a large scope for the personality of
the instructor. Thus, long before the
days of universities, Alcuin was the moving
spirit in the revival of education at
the court of Charlemagne and the monastery
school of Tours, and two centuries
later Gerbert of Rheims roused the wonder
of contemporaries by his skilful use of
the classics in the study of rhetoric and by
devices for the teaching of astronomy so
ingenious that they seemed in some way
&#8220;divine.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> From the period of university
origins we get a fairly clear impression
of Abelard as a teacher and &#8216;class-room
entertainer,&#8217; bold, original, lucid,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
sharply polemical, always fresh and stimulating,
and withal &#8220;able to move to
laughter the minds of serious men.&#8221; His
procedure as exhibited in his <i>Sic et non</i>
was to marshal authorities and arguments
for and against specific propositions,
a method which was soon imitated
in Gratian&#8217;s <i>Concord of Discordant Canons</i>,
and, re&euml;nforced by the <i>New Logic</i>
of Aristotle, was to culminate in the
scholastic method of St. Thomas Aquinas
and stamp itself upon the thought of
many generations. Sharpening to the
wits as this method was in the hands of
Abelard and his successors, the very antagonism
of yes or no as he formulated it
left no room for intermediate positions,
for those <i>nuances</i> of thought in which, as
Renan pointed out, truth is usually to be
found.</p>

<p>For a contemporary impression of the
teachers of the twelfth century, nothing is
so good as the oft-quoted passages in
which John of Salisbury describes his
<i>Wanderjahre</i> in France from 1136 to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
1147, chiefly at Paris and Chartres.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Learning the rudiments of dialectic from
Abelard, he continued under two other
teachers of this art, one over-scrupulous
in detail, perspicuous, brief, and to the
point, the other subtle and profuse, showing
that simple answers could not be
given. &#8220;Afterward one of them went to
Bologna and unlearned what he had
taught, so that on his return he also untaught
it.&#8221; John then passed on to
Chartres to study grammar under William
of Conches and Bernard. The humane
yet thorough teaching of literature here
excited his warm admiration&mdash;close
study, memorizing choice extracts, grammar
taught by composition, imitation of
excellent models but merciless exposure of
borrowed finery, qualities which made Bernard
&#8220;the most copious source of letters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
in Gaul in modern times.&#8221; Returning to
Paris after twelve years&#8217; absence, John
found his old companions &#8220;as before, and
where they were before; nor did they appear
to have reached the goal in unravelling
the old questions, nor had they added
one jot of a proposition. The aims that
once inspired them, inspired them still:
they had progressed in one point only:
they had unlearned moderation, they
knew not modesty; in such wise that one
might despair of their recovery. And
thus experience taught me a manifest
conclusion, that, whereas dialectic furthers
other studies, so if it remain by itself it lies
bloodless and barren, nor does it quicken
the soul to yield fruit of philosophy, except
the same conceive from elsewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>The teachers of the thirteenth century
who talk most about themselves are the
professors of grammar and rhetoric like
Buoncompagno at Bologna, John of Garlande
at Paris, Ponce of Provence at
Orleans, and Lorenzo of Aquileia at
Naples and almost everywhere, but we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
shall make sufficient acquaintance with
their inflated writings in other connections.
More significant is the account
which Odofredus gives of his lectures on
the <i>Old Digest</i> at Bologna:</p>

<p>&#8220;Concerning the method of teaching
the following order was kept by ancient
and modern doctors and especially by my
own master, which method I shall observe:
First, I shall give you summaries
of each title before I proceed to the text;
second, I shall give you as clear and explicit
a statement as I can of the purport
of each law [included in the title]; third,
I shall read the text with a view to correcting
it; fourth, I shall briefly repeat the
contents of the law; fifth, I shall solve
apparent contradictions, adding any general
principles of law [to be extracted
from the passage], commonly called
&#8216;Brocardica,&#8217; and any distinctions or
subtle and useful problems (<i>quaestiones</i>)
arising out of the law with their solutions,
as far as the Divine Providence shall enable
me. And if any law shall seem deserving,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
by reason of its celebrity or difficulty,
of a repetition, I shall reserve it
for an evening repetition, for I shall dispute
at least twice a year, once before
Christmas and once before Easter, if you
like.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall always begin the <i>Old Digest</i> on
or about the octave of Michaelmas [6
October] and finish it entirely, by God&#8217;s
help, with everything ordinary and extraordinary,
about the middle of August.
The <i>Code</i> I shall always begin about a
fortnight after Michaelmas and by God&#8217;s
help complete it, with everything ordinary
and extraordinary, about the first of
August. Formerly the doctors did not
lecture on the extraordinary portions;
but with me all students can have profit,
even the ignorant and the new-comers, for
they will hear the whole book, nor will
anything be omitted as was once the common
practice here. For the ignorant can
profit by the statement of the case and the
exposition of the text, the more advanced
can become more adept in the subtleties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
of questions and opposing opinions.
And I shall read all the glosses, which was
not the practice before my time.&#8221; Then
comes certain general advice as to the
choice of teachers and the methods of
study, followed by some general account
of the <i>Digest</i>.</p>

<p>This course closed as follows: &#8220;Now
gentlemen, we have begun and finished
and gone through this book as you know
who have been in the class, for which we
thank God and His Virgin Mother and
all His saints. It is an ancient custom in
this city that when a book is finished mass
should be sung to the Holy Ghost, and it
is a good custom and hence should be observed.
But since it is the practice that
doctors on finishing a book should say
something of their plans, I will tell you
something but not much. Next year I
expect to give ordinary lectures well and
lawfully as I always have, but no extraordinary
lectures, for students are not good
payers, wishing to learn but not to pay,
as the saying is: All desire to know but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
none to pay the price. I have nothing
more to say to you beyond dismissing you
with God&#8217;s blessing and begging you to
attend the mass.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Important as was the formal lecture in
those days of few books and no laboratories,
it was by no means the sole vehicle
of instruction. A comprehensive survey
of university teaching would need also to
take account of the less formal &#8216;cursory&#8217;
or &#8216;extraordinary&#8217; lectures, many of
them given by mere bachelors; the reviews
and &#8216;repetitions,&#8217; which were often given
in hospices or colleges in the evenings;
and the disputations which prepared for
the final ordeal of maintaining publicly
the graduation thesis.</p>

<p>The class-rooms in which these lectures
were given have long since disappeared.
If the master&#8217;s house had no suitable
room, he literally hired a hall in some convenient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
neighborhood. At Paris such
halls were mostly in a single street on the
Left Bank, the Vicus Stramineus or Rue
du Fouarre celebrated by Dante, apparently
so-called from the straw-covered
floor on which the students sat as they
took notes. At Bologna the class-rooms
were rather more ambitious. Here Buoncompagno,
writing in 1235, has described
an ideal lecture hall, quiet and clean, with
a fair prospect from its windows, its walls
painted green but with no pictures or statues
to distract attention, the lecturer&#8217;s seat
elevated so that he may see and be seen by
all, the seats of the students permanently
assigned by nations and according to individual
rank and fame; but he adds significantly,
&#8220;I never had such a house myself
and do not believe any of this sort was
ever built.&#8221; Our knowledge of the realities
of the Bolognese class-room is derived
chiefly from the monuments and
miniatures of the professors of the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, in which
the master is regularly seated at a desk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
under a canopy on a raised platform,
while the students have flat or inclined
desks on which their books lie open. The
professors, in medicine as in law, regularly
have an open volume before them.</p>

<p>The nature of the final examination
is best illustrated at Paris, where it is described
in the <i>De conscientia</i> of that genial
moralist, Robert de Sorbon, founder
of the Sorbonne, by means of a suggestive
parallel with the Last Judgment. Taking
as his text Job&#8217;s desire that his &#8220;adversary
had written a book,&#8221; and outlining
his headings in the approved fashion of
his time, Robert begins with the statement
that if any one decides to seek the <i>licentia
legendi</i> at Paris and cannot be excused
from examination&mdash;as many of the great,
by special favor, are&mdash;he would much
like to be told by the chancellor, or by
some one in his confidence, on what book
he would be examined. Just as he would
be a crazy student indeed, who, having
found out which book this was, should
neglect it and spend his time on others,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
even so is he mad who fails to study the
book of his own conscience, in which we
shall all, without exception, be examined
at the great day. Moreover, if any one
is rejected by the chancellor, he may be re&euml;xamined
after a year, or it may be that,
through the intercession of friends or by
suitable gifts or services to the chancellor&#8217;s
relatives or other examiners, the
chancellor can be induced to change his decision;
whereas at the Last Judgment the
sentence will be final and there will be no
help from wealth or influence or stout assertion
of ability as canonist or civilian or
of familiarity with all arguments and all
fallacies. Then, if one fails before the
chancellor of Paris, the fact is known to
but five or six and the mortification passes
away in time, while the Great Chancellor,
God, will refute the sinner &#8216;in full university&#8217;
before the whole world. The chancellor,
too, does not flog the candidate, but
in the Last Judgment the guilty will be
beaten with a rod of iron from the valley
of Jehosaphat through the length of hell,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
nor can we reckon, like idle boys in the
grammar-schools, on escaping Saturday&#8217;s
punishment by feigning illness, playing
truant, or being stronger than the master,
or like them solace ourselves with the
thought that after all our fun is well
worth a whipping. The chancellor&#8217;s examination,
too, is voluntary; he does
not force any one to seek the degree, but
waits as long as the scholars wish, and is
even burdened with their insistent demands
for examinations. In studying
the book of our conscience we should imitate
the candidates for the license, who
eat and drink sparingly, conning steadily
the one book they are preparing, searching
out all the authorities that pertain to
this, and hearing only the professors that
lecture on this subject, so that they have
difficulty in concealing from their fellows
the fact that they are preparing for examination.
Such preparation is not the
work of five or ten days&mdash;though there
are many who will not meditate a day or
an hour on their sins&mdash;but of many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
years. At the examination the chancellor
asks, &#8220;Brother, what do you say to
this question, what do you say to this one
and this one?&#8221; The chancellor is not
satisfied with a verbal knowledge of books
without an understanding of their sense,
but unlike the Great Judge, who will hear
the book of our conscience from beginning
to end and suffer no mistakes, he requires
only seven or eight passages in a book and
passes the candidate if he answers three
questions out of four. Still another difference
lies in the fact that the chancellor
does not always conduct the examination
in person, so that the student who would
be terrified in the presence of so much
learning often answers well before the
masters who act in the chancellor&#8217;s place.
Nothing is here said of the public maintenance
of a thesis against all comers, an
important final exercise which still survives
as a form in German universities.</p>

<p>At Bologna there was first a &#8220;rigorous
and tremendous examination&#8221; before
doctors, each sworn to treat the candidate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
&#8220;as he would his own son.&#8221; Then followed
a public examination and inception
which a letter home described as follows:
&#8220;&#8216;Sing unto the Lord a new song, praise
him with stringed instruments and organs,
rejoice upon the high-sounding cymbals,&#8217;
for your son has held a glorious disputation,
which was attended by a great multitude
of teachers and scholars. He answered
all questions without a mistake,
and no one could prevail against his arguments.
Moreover he celebrated a famous
banquet, at which both rich and poor were
honored as never before, and he has duly
begun to give lectures which are already
so popular that others&#8217; class-rooms are
deserted and his own are filled.&#8221; The
same rhetorician also tells of an unsuccessful
candidate who could do nothing in the
disputation but sat in his chair like a
goat while the spectators in derision called
him rabbi; his guests at the banquet had
such eating that they had no will to drink,
and he must needs hire students to attend
his classes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>The social position of mediaeval professors
must be seen against the background
of the social system of a different
age from ours. We come perhaps nearest
to modern conditions in the cities of Italy,
where there is evidence in the Middle
Ages as now of the distinguished position
of many professors of medicine and civil
law. Many theologians and teachers of
canon law reached high places in the
church such as bishoprics and cardinalates.
Among the theologians and philosophers
those of highest distinction were
regularly university professors: Thomas
Aquinas, Albertus Magnus, Bonaventura,
all the great array of doctors angelic,
invincible, irrefragable, seraphic, subtle,
and universal. That these were also Dominicans
or Franciscans withdrew them
only partially from the world.</p>

<p>If, as some reformers maintain, the
social position and self-respect of professors
involve their management of university
affairs, the Middle Ages were the
great age of professorial control. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
university itself was a society of masters
when it was not a society of students. As
there were no endowments of importance
there were no boards of trustees, nor was
there any such system of state control as
exists on the Continent or in many parts
of the United States. Administration in
the modern sense was strikingly absent,
but much time was consumed in various
sorts of university meetings. In a quite
remarkable degree the university was
self-governing as well as self-respecting,
escaping some of the abuses of a system
which occasionally allows trustees or regents
to speak of professors as their
&#8220;hired men.&#8221; Whether the individual
professor was freer under such a system
is another question, for the corporation of
masters was apt to exercise a pretty close
control over action if not over opinion,
and the tyranny of colleagues is a form of
that &#8220;tyranny of one&#8217;s next-door neighbor&#8221;
from which the world seems unable
to escape.</p>

<p>There remains the question of the professor&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
intellectual liberty, the right to
teach truth as he sees it, which we have
come to call academic freedom. It is plain
that much depends here, as with Pilate,
on our conception of truth. If it is something
to be discovered by search, the
search must be free and untrammelled.
If, however, truth is something which has
already been revealed to us by authority,
then it has only to be expounded, and the
expositor must be faithful to the authoritative
doctrine. Needless to say, the latter
was the mediaeval conception of truth and
its teaching. &#8220;Faith,&#8221; it was held, &#8220;precedes
science, fixes its boundaries, and
prescribes its conditions.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> &#8220;I believe in
order that I may know, I do not know in
order to believe,&#8221; said Anselm. If reason
has its bounds thus set, it befits reason to
be humble. Let not the masters and students
of Paris, says Gregory IX, &#8220;show
themselves philosophers, but let them
strive to become God&#8217;s learned.&#8221; The
dangers of intellectual pride and reliance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
upon reason alone are illustrated by many
characteristic stories of masters struck
dumb in the midst of their boasting, like
&Eacute;tienne de Tournay, who, having proved
the doctrine of the Trinity &#8220;so lucidly,
so elegantly, so catholically,&#8221; asserted
that he could just as easily demolish his
own proof. Mediaeval orthodoxy looked
askance at mere cleverness, partly because
much of the discussion of the schools led
nowhere, partly because a mind that
played too freely about a proposition
might easily fall into heresy. And for the
detection and punishment of heresy the
mediaeval church organized a special system
of courts known as the Inquisition.</p>

<p>Such being the general conditions, what
was the actual situation? In practice freedom
was general, save in philosophy and
theology. In law, in medicine, in grammar
and mathematics, men were normally
free to lecture and dispute as they would.
As there was no social problem in the
modern sense and no teaching of the social
sciences as such, a fruitful source of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
difficulty was absent. So far as I know,
no mediaeval professor was condemned
for preaching free trade or free silver or
socialism or non-resistance. Moreover,
while individual treatises might be publicly
burnt, as in the later Roman Empire,
there was no organized censorship of
books before the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Now as to philosophy and theology.
The trouble lies of course with theology,
for philosophy was free save when it
touched theological questions. But then,
philosophy is very apt to touch theological
questions, and all through
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
there was an intermittent fight between
Christian theology and pagan philosophy
as represented by the works of
Aristotle. It began with Abelard when
he tried to apply his logical method of
inquiry to theology, and it went on when
his contemporary, Gilbert de la Porr&eacute;e, directed
still more of the Aristotelian logic
toward theological speculation. By the
end of the twelfth century, the <i>New Logic</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
was pretty well assimilated, but then
came Aristotle&#8217;s <i>Metaphysics</i> and natural
philosophy, with their Arabic commentators,
the study of which at Paris was
formally forbidden in 1210 and 1215. In
1231 the Pope requires them to be &#8220;examined
and purged of all suspicion of
error,&#8221; but by 1254 they are a fixed part
of the curriculum in arts, not expurgated
but reconciled by interpretation to the
Christian faith. A generation later there
is a recrudescence of Averroism, emphasizing
the doctrine of the eternity of matter
and the determination of earthly acts
by the heavenly bodies; and two hundred
and nineteen errors of this party were condemned
in 1277 by the bishop of Paris,
who took occasion to lament incursions
into theology on the part of students of
arts. Throughout this period the whole
of Aristotle was taught and studied at
Paris, and his method was used by
Thomas Aquinas to rear his vast structure
of scholastic theology. Others reserved
for themselves a wide range of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
philosophic speculation, and in case of
trouble they could save themselves by
falling back on the doctrine that what was
true in philosophy might be false in theology,
and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>With an eye to this question of freedom
of teaching, I have gone through all the
documents of the thirteenth century in
the Paris <i>Chartularium</i>. Outside of the
great controversies just mentioned the result
is meagre. In 1241 a series of ten
errors was examined and condemned by
the chancellor and the professors of theology,
a very abstract series of propositions
dealing with the visibility of the divine
essence, angels, and the exact abiding-place
of glorified souls in the next
world, whether in the empyrean or the
crystalline heaven. In 1247 it appears
that a certain Master Raymond had been
imprisoned for his errors by the advice of
the masters of theology, and one John de
Brescain had been deprived of his right
to teach because of certain errors in logic
&#8220;which seemed to come near Arian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
heresy,&#8221; thus confusing the subjects of
the two faculties, whose bounds had
been set by the fathers. In and about
1255 Paris was in a ferment over the so-called
&#8216;Eternal Gospel,&#8217; an apocalyptic
treatise which foretold a new era of the
Spirit, beginning in 1260, in which the
New Testament, the Pope, and the hierarchy
should be superseded. Accepted
by certain advanced Franciscans, these
doctrines became the occasion of a long
conflict with the Mendicant orders, but
with no very decisive results. In 1277
Paris received notice of thirty errors in
arts condemned at Oxford, not as heretical
but as sufficient to cause the deposition
of the master teaching them; but
when we find among them the abolition
of the cases of Latin nouns and the personal
endings of verbs (<i>ego currit</i>, <i>tu
currit</i>, etc.), we are likely to sympathize
more with their unfortunate students than
with the deposed masters. One is reminded
of the modern definition of academic
freedom as &#8220;the right to say what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
one thinks without thinking what one
says!&#8221;</p>

<p>With these as the only notable examples
of interference with free teaching at
the storm centre of theological speculation
in the most active period of its history,
we must infer that there was a large
amount of actual freedom. Trouble arose
almost entirely out of what was deemed
theological heresy, or undue meddling
with theological subjects by those who
lacked theological training. Those who
stuck to their job seem generally to have
been let alone. As the great jurist Cujas
replied in the sixteenth century when
asked whether he was Protestant or Catholic,
<i>Nihil hoc ad edictum praetoris</i>. Even
within the more carefully guarded field
of theology and philosophy, it is doubtful
whether many found themselves cramped.
Accepting the principle of authority as
their starting-point, men did not feel its
limitations as we should feel them now.
A fence is no obstacle to those who do not
desire to go outside, and many barriers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
that would seem intolerable to a more
sceptical age were not felt as barriers by
the schoolmen. He is free who feels himself
free.</p>

<p>Furthermore, for those accustomed to
the wide diversities of the modern world,
it is easy to form a false impression of the
uniformity and sameness of mediaeval
thought. Scholasticism was not one thing
but many, as its historians constantly remind
us, and the contests between different
schools and shades of opinion were as
keen as among the Greeks or in our own
day. And if the differences often seem
minute or unreal to our distant eye, we
can make them modern enough by turning,
for example, to the old question of
the nature of universal conceptions, which
divided the Nominalists and Realists of
the Middle Ages. Are universals mere
names, or have they a real existence, independent
of their individual embodiments?
A bit arid it all sounds if we
make it merely a matter of logic, but exciting
enough as soon as it becomes a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
question of life. The essence of the Reformation
lies implicit in whether we take
a nominalist or a realist view of the
church; the central problem of politics depends
largely upon a nominalist or a realist
view of the state. Upon the two sides
of this last question millions of men have
&#8220;all uncouthly died,&#8221; all unconsciously
too, no doubt, in the majority of cases,
unaware of the ultimate issues of political
authority for which they fought, but yet
able to comprehend them when expressed
in the concrete form of putting the interest
of the state above the interest of its
members.</p>

<p>In his own time and his own way the
mediaeval professor often dealt with permanent
human interests as he sharpened
men&#8217;s wits and kept alive the continuous
tradition of learning.</p>

THE MEDIAEVAL STUDENT</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">A University</span>,&#8221; it has more than
once been remarked by professors, &#8220;would
be a very comfortable place were it not
for the students.&#8221; So far we have been
considering universities from the point of
view of professors; it is now the turn of
the students, for whether these be regarded
as a necessary evil or as the main
reason for the university&#8217;s existence, they
certainly cannot be ignored. A mediaeval
university was no regiment of colonels
but &#8220;a society of masters <i>and
scholars</i>,&#8221; and to this second and more
numerous element we must now direct
our attention.</p>

<p>The mediaeval student is a more elusive
figure than his teachers, for he is
individually less conspicuous and must
generally be seen in the mass. Moreover<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
the mass is much diversified in time and
space, so that generalization is difficult,
what is true of one age and one university
being quite untrue of other times and
places. Even within the briefer span of
American universities there are wide
differences among the students of, let us
say, Harvard in the seventeenth century,
William and Mary in the eighteenth century,
California in the nineteenth century,
and Columbia in the twentieth century;
and it would be impossible to make a true
picture out of elements drawn indiscriminately
from such disparate sources. Until
the conditions at each university of the
Middle Ages shall have been studied
chronologically, no sound account of student
life in general can be written, and
this preliminary labor has nowhere been
systematically attempted. At present we
can do no more than indicate the principal
sources of our information and the kind
of light they throw upon student life.</p>

<p>Fortunately, out of the scattered remains
of mediaeval times, there has come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
down to us a considerable body of material
which deals, more or less directly,
with student affairs. There are, for one
thing, the records of the courts of law,
which, amid the monotonous detail of
petty disorders and oft-repeated offences,
preserve now and then a vivid bit of
mediaeval life&mdash;like the case of the
Bolognese student who was attacked with
a cutlass in a class-room, to the great
damage and loss of those assembled to
hear the lecture of a noble and egregious
doctor of laws; or the student in 1289
who was set upon in the street in front
of a lecture-room by a certain scribe,
&#8220;who wounded him on the head with a
stone, so that much blood gushed forth,&#8221;
while two companions gave aid and counsel,
saying, &#8220;Give it to him, hit him,&#8221;
and when the offence had been committed
ran away. So the coroners&#8217; rolls of Oxford
record many a fatal issue of town
and gown riots, while a recently published
register of 1265 and 1266 shows the
students of Bologna actively engaged in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
raising money by loans and by the sale of
textbooks. There are of course the
university and college statutes, with their
prohibitions and fines, regulating the
subjects of conversation, the shape and
color of caps and gowns, that academic
dress which looks to us so mediaeval and
is, especially in its American form, so
very modern; careful also of the weightier
matters of the law, like the enactment
of New College against throwing stones
in chapel, or the graded penalties at
Leipzig for him who picks up a missile
to throw at a professor, him who throws
and misses, and him who accomplishes his
fell purpose to the master&#8217;s hurt. The
chroniclers, too, sometimes interrupt their
narrative of the affairs of kings and
princes to tell of students and their doings,
although their attention, like that of their
modern successors, the newspapers, is
apt to be caught by outbreaks of student
lawlessness rather than by the wholesome
routine of academic life.</p>

<p>Then we have the preachers of the time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
many of them also professors, whose sermons
contain frequent allusions to student
customs; indeed if further evidence
were needed to dispel the illusion that the
mediaeval university was devoted to biblical
study and religious nurture, the
Paris preachers of the period would offer
sufficient proof. &#8220;The student&#8217;s heart
is in the mire,&#8221; says one of them, &#8220;fixed
on prebends and things temporal and how
to satisfy his desires.&#8221; &#8220;They are so litigious
and quarrelsome that there is no
peace with them; wherever they go, be it
Paris or Orleans, they disturb the country,
their associates, even the whole university.&#8221;
Many of them go about the streets
armed, attacking the citizens, breaking
into houses, and abusing women. They
quarrel among themselves over dogs,
women, or what-not, slashing off one
another&#8217;s fingers with their swords, or,
with only knives in their hands and
nothing to protect their tonsured pates,
rush into conflicts from which armed
knights would hold back. Their compatriots<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
come to their aid, and soon whole
nations of students may be involved in
the fray. These Paris preachers take us
into the very atmosphere of the Latin
quarter and show us much of its varied
activity. We hear the cries and songs
of the streets&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Li tens s&#8217;en veit,</div>
<div class="verse">Et je n&#8217;ei riens fait;</div>
<div class="verse">Li tens revient,</div>
<div class="verse">Et je ne fais riens&mdash;</div>
</div></div>

<p>the students&#8217; tambourines and guitars,
their &#8220;light and scurrilous words,&#8221; their
hisses and handclappings and loud shouts
of applause at sermons and disputations.
We watch them as they mock a neighbor
for her false hair or stick out their tongues
and make faces at the passers-by. We
see the student studying by his window,
talking over his future with his room-mate,
receiving visits from his parents,
nursed by friends when he is ill, singing
psalms at a student&#8217;s funeral, or visiting
a fellow-student and asking him to visit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
him&mdash;&#8220;I have been to see you, now come
to our hospice.&#8221;</p>

<p>All types are represented. There is the
poor student, with no friend but St.
Nicholas, seeking such charity as he can
find or earning a pittance by carrying
holy water or copying for others, in a fair
but none too accurate hand, sometimes
too poor to buy books or afford the expense
of a course in theology, yet usually
surpassing his more prosperous fellows
who have an abundance of books at which
they never look. There is the well-to-do
student, who besides his books and desk
will be sure to have a candle in his room
and a comfortable bed with a soft mattress
and luxurious coverings, and will
be tempted to indulge the mediaeval
fondness for fine raiment beyond the
gown and hood and simple wardrobe
prescribed by the statutes. Then there
are the idle and aimless, drifting about
from master to master and from school
to school, and never hearing full courses
or regular lectures. Some, who care only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
for the name of scholar and the income
which they receive while attending the
university, go to class but once or twice
a week, choosing by preference the lectures
on canon law, which leave them
plenty of time for sleep in the morning.
Many eat cakes when they ought to be at
study, or go to sleep in the class-rooms,
spending the rest of their time drinking
in taverns or building castles in Spain
(<i>castella in Hispania</i>); and when it is
time to leave Paris, in order to make some
show of learning such students get together
huge volumes of calfskin, with
wide margins and fine red bindings, and
so with wise sack and empty mind they
go back to their parents. &#8220;What knowledge
is this,&#8221; asks the preacher, &#8220;which
thieves may steal, mice or moths eat up,
fire or water destroy?&#8221; and he cites an
instance where the student&#8217;s horse fell
into a river, carrying all his books with
him. Some never go home, but continue
to enjoy in idleness the fruits of their
benefices. Even in vacation time, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
the rich ride off with their servants and
the poor trudge home under the burning
sun, many idlers remain in Paris to their
own and the city&#8217;s harm. Mediaeval
Paris, we should remember, was not only
the incomparable &#8220;parent of the sciences,&#8221;
but also a place of good cheer and good
fellowship and varied delights, a favorite
resort not only of the studious but of
country priests on a holiday; and it would
not be strange if sometimes scholars prolonged
their stay unduly and lamented
their departure in phrases which are something
more than rhetorical commonplace.</p>

<p>Then the student is not unknown to the
poets of the period, among whom Rutebeuf
gives a picture of thirteenth-century
Paris not unlike that of the
sermonizers, while in the preceding century
Jean de Hauteville shows the misery
of the poor and diligent scholar falling
asleep over his books, and Nigel &#8220;Wireker&#8221;
satirizes the English students at
Paris in the person of an ass, Brunellus,&mdash;&#8220;Daun
Burnell&#8221; in Chaucer&mdash;who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
studies there seven years without learning
a word, braying at the end as at the beginning
of his course, and leaving at last
with the resolve to become a monk or a
bishop. Best of all is Chaucer&#8217;s incomparable
portrait of the clerk of Oxenford,
hollow, threadbare, unworldly&mdash;</p>

<p>But after all, no one knows so much
about student life as the students themselves,
and it is particularly from what
was written by and for them, the student
literature of the Middle Ages, that I wish
to draw more at length. Such remains
of the academic past fall into three
chief classes: student manuals, student
letters, and student poetry. Let us consider
them in this order.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>The manuals of general advice and
counsel addressed to the mediaeval
scholar do not call for extended consideration.
Formal treatises on the whole
duty of students are characteristic of the
didactic habit of mind of the Middle
Ages, but the advice which they contain
is apt to be of a very general sort,
applicable to one age as well as another
and lacking in those concrete illustrations
which enliven the sermons of the
period into useful sources for university
life.</p>

<p>A more interesting type of student
manual, the student dictionary, owes its
existence to the position of Latin as the
universal language of mediaeval education.
Textbooks were in Latin, lectures
were in Latin, and, what is more, the use
of Latin was compulsory in all forms of
student intercourse. This rule may have
been designed as a check on conversation,
as well as an incentive to learning, but it
was enforced by penalties and informers
(called wolves), and the freshman, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
yellow-beak, as he was termed in mediaeval
parlance, might find himself but ill
equipped for making himself understood
in his new community. For his convenience
a master in the University of
Paris in the thirteenth century, John of
Garlande, prepared a descriptive vocabulary,
topically arranged and devoting a
large amount of space to the objects to
be seen in the course of a walk through
the streets of Paris. The reader is conducted
from quarter to quarter and from
trade to trade, from the book-stalls of the
Parvis Notre-Dame and the fowl-market
of the adjoining Rue Neuve to the
money-changers&#8217; tables and goldsmiths&#8217;
shops on the Grand-Pont and the bow-makers
of the Porte S.-Lazare, not omitting
the classes of <i>ouvri&egrave;res</i> whose acquaintance
the student was most likely
to make. Saddlers and glovers, furriers,
cobblers, and apothecaries, the clerk
might have use for the wares of all of
them, as well as the desk and candle and
writing-materials which were the special<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
tools of his calling; but his most frequent
relations were with the purveyors of food
and drink, whose agents plied their trade
vigorously through the streets and lanes
of the Latin quarter and worked off their
poorer goods on scholars and their servants.
There were the hawkers of wine,
crying their samples of different qualities
from the taverns; the fruit-sellers,
deceiving clerks with lettuce and cress,
cherries, pears, and green apples; and at
night the vendors of light pastry, with
their carefully covered baskets of wafers,
waffles, and rissoles&mdash;a frequent stake
at the games of dice among students,
who had a custom of hanging from their
windows the baskets gained by lucky
throws of the six. The <i>p&acirc;tissiers</i> had also
more substantial wares suited to the clerical
taste, tarts filled with eggs and cheese
and well-peppered pies of pork, chicken,
and eels. To the <i>r&ocirc;tissiers</i> scholars&#8217; servants
resorted, not only for the pigeons,
geese, and other fowl roasted on their
spits, but also for uncooked beef, pork,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
and mutton, seasoned with garlic and
other strong sauces. Such fare, however,
was not for the poorer students, whose
slender purses limited them to tripe and
various kinds of sausage, over which a
quarrel might easily arise and &#8220;the
butchers be themselves butchered by
angry scholars.&#8221;</p>

<p>A dictionary of this sort easily passes
into another type of treatise, the manual
of conversation. This method of studying
foreign languages is old, as survivals
from ancient Egypt testify, and it still
spreads its snares for the unwary traveller
who prepares to conquer Europe <i>&agrave; la</i>
Ollendorff. To the writers of the later
Middle Ages it seemed to offer an exceptional
opportunity for combining
Instruction in Latin with sound academic
discipline, and from both school and
university it left its monuments for our
perusal. The most interesting of these
handbooks is entitled a &#8220;Manual of
Scholars who propose to attend universities
of students and to profit therein,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
and while in its most common form it is
designed for the students of Heidelberg
about the year 1480, it could be adapted
with slight changes to any of the German
universities. &#8220;Rollo at Heidelberg,&#8221; we
might call it. Its eighteen chapters conduct
the student from his matriculation
to his degree, and inform him by the way
on many subjects quite unnecessary for
either. When the young man arrives he
registers from Ulm; his parents are in
moderate circumstances; he has come to
study. He is then duly hazed after the
German fashion, which treats the candidate
as an unclean beast with horns and
tusks which must be removed by officious
fellow-students, who also hear his confession
of sin and fix as the penance a
good dinner for the crowd. He begins
his studies by attending three lectures a
day, and learns to champion nominalism
against realism and the comedies of
Terence against the law, and to discuss
the advantages of various universities
and the price of food and the quality of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
the beer in university towns. Then we
find him and his room-mate quarrelling
over a mislaid book; rushing at the first
sound of the bell to dinner, where they
debate the relative merits of veal and
beans; or walking in the fields beyond the
Neckar, perhaps by the famous Philosophers&#8217;
Road which has charmed so many
generations of Heidelberg youth, and
exchanging Latin remarks on the birds
and fish as they go. Then there are
shorter dialogues: the scholar breaks the
statutes; he borrows money, and gets it
back; he falls in love and recovers; he
goes to hear a fat Italian monk preach or
to see the jugglers and the jousting in
the market-place; he knows the dog-days
are coming&mdash;he can feel them in his
head! Finally our student is told by his
parents that it is high time for him to
take his degree and come home. At this
he is much disturbed; he has gone to few
lectures, and he will have to swear that
he has attended regularly; he has not
worked much and has incurred the enmity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
of many professors; his master discourages
him from trying the examination;
he fears the disgrace of failure. But his
interlocutor reassures him by a pertinent
quotation from Ovid and suggests that a
judicious distribution of gifts may do
much&mdash;a few florins will win him the
favor of all. Let him write home for more
money and give a great feast for his
professors; if he treats them well, he need
not fear the outcome. This advice throws
a curious light upon the educational
standards of the time; it appears to have
been followed, for the manual closes with
a set of forms inviting the masters to the
banquet and the free bath by which it
was preceded.</p>

<p>If university students had need of such
elementary compends of morals and manners,
there was obviously plenty of room
for them in the lower schools as well,
where they were apt to take the form of
Latin couplets which could be readily
impressed upon the pupil&#8217;s memory.
Such <i>statuta vel precepta scolarium</i> seem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
to have been especially popular in the
later fifteenth century in those city schools
of Germany whose importance has been
so clearly brought out by recent historians
of secondary education. Wandering
often from town to town, like the roving
scholars of an earlier age, these German
boys had good need to observe the moral
maxims thus purveyed. The beginning
of wisdom was to remember God and obey
the master, but the student had also to
watch his behavior in church and lift up
his voice in the choir&mdash;compulsory attendance
at church and singing in the
choir being a regular feature of these
schools&mdash;keep his books clean, and pay
his school bills promptly. Face and hands
should be washed in the morning, but
the baths should not be visited without
permission, nor should boys run on the
ice or throw snowballs. Sunday was the
day for play, but this could be only in
the churchyard, where boys must be careful
not to play with dice or break stones
from the wall or throw anything over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
church. And whether at play or at home,
Latin should always be spoken.</p>

<p>More systematic is a manual of the
fifteenth century preserved in a manuscript
of the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale at
Paris.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> &#8220;Since by reason of imbecility
youths cannot advance to a knowledge of
the Latin tongue by theory alone,&#8221; the
author has for their assistance prepared
a set of forms which contain the expressions
most frequently employed by clerks.
Beginning with the courtesies of school
life, for obedience and due reverence for
the master are the beginning of wisdom,
the boy learns how to greet his master and
to take leave, how to excuse himself for
wrong-doing, how to invite the master to
dine or sup with his parents&mdash;there are
half a dozen forms for this! He is also
taught how to give proper answers to
those who seek to test his knowledge,
&#8220;that he may not appear an idiot in the
sight of his parents.&#8221; &#8220;If the master
asks, &#8216;Where have you been so long?&#8217;&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
must be ready, not only to plead the inevitable
headache or failure to wake up, but
also to express the causes of delay well
known to any village boy. He had to look
after the house or feed the cattle or water
the horse; he was detained by a wedding,
by picking grapes, or making out bills, or&mdash;for
these were German boys&mdash;by
helping with the brew, fetching beer, or
serving drink to guests.</p>

<p>In school after the &#8220;spiritual refection&#8221;
of the morning singing-lesson
comes refection of the body, which is
placed after study hours because &#8220;the
imaginative virtue is generally impeded in
those who are freshly sated.&#8221; In their
talk at luncheon or on the playground
&#8220;clerks are apt to fall from the Latin
idiom into the mother tongue,&#8221; and for
him who speaks German the discretion of
the master has invented a dunce&#8217;s symbol
called an ass, which the holder tries hard
to pass on to another. &#8220;Wer wel ein
Griffel kouffe[n]?&#8221; &#8220;Ich wel ein Griffel
kouffen.&#8221; &#8220;Tecum sit asinus.&#8221; &#8220;Ach,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
quam falsus es tu!&#8221; Sometimes the
victim offers to meet his deceiver after
vespers, with the usual schoolboy brag on
both sides. As it is forbidden to come to
blows in school, the boys are taught to
work off their enmities and formulate
their complaints in Latin dialogue. &#8220;You
were outside the town after dark. You
played with laymen Sunday. You went
swimming Monday. You stayed away
from matins. You slept through mass.&#8221;
&#8220;Reverend master, he has soiled my book,
he shouts after me wherever I go, he calls
me names.&#8221; Besides the formal disputations
the scholars discuss such
current events as a street fight, a cousin&#8217;s
wedding, the coming war with the duke
of Saxony, or the means of getting to
Erfurt, whither one of them is going when
he is sixteen to study at the university.
The great ordeal of the day was the master&#8217;s
quiz on Latin grammar, when every
one was questioned in turn (<i>auditio circuli</i>).
The pupils rehearse their declensions
and conjugations and the idle begin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
to tremble as the hour draws near. There
is some hope that the master may not
come. &#8220;He has guests.&#8221; &#8220;But they
will leave in time.&#8221; &#8220;He may go to the
baths.&#8221; &#8220;But it is not yet a whole week
since he was there last.&#8221; &#8220;There he
comes. Name the wolf, and he forthwith
appears.&#8221; Finally the shaky scholar falls
back on his only hope, a place near one
who promises to prompt him.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the recitation is over and the
lesson given out, rejoicing begins among
the youth at the approach of the hour for
going home,&#8221; and they indulge in much
idle talk &#8220;which is here omitted, lest it
furnish the means of offending.&#8221; Joy is,
however, tempered by the contest which
precedes dismissal, &#8220;a serious and furious
disputation for the <i>palmiterium</i>,&#8221; until
one secures the prize and another has the
<i>asinus</i> to keep till next day.</p>

<p>After school the boys go to play in the
churchyard, the sports mentioned being
hoops, marbles (apparently), ball (during
Lent), and a kind of counting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
game. The author distinguishes hoops
for throwing and for rolling, spheres of
wood and of stone, but the subject soon
becomes too deep for his Latin, and in the
midst of this topic the treatise comes to
an abrupt conclusion.</p>

<p>In some of its forms the student
manual touches on territory already occupied
by another type of mediaeval
handbook, the manual of manners, which
under such titles as &#8220;The Book of Urbanity,&#8221;
&#8220;The Courtesies of the Table,&#8221;
etc., enjoyed much popularity from the
thirteenth century onward. Such manuals
have, however, none of the polish of
Castiglione&#8217;s <i>Courtier</i> or the elaborateness
of the modern book of etiquette.
Those who have not mastered the use of
knife and fork have little use for the finer
points of social intercourse, and the readers
of the mediaeval manuals were still
at their a b c&#8217;s in the matter of behavior.
Wash your hands in the morning and,
if you have time, your face; use your
napkin and handkerchief; eat with three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
fingers, and don&#8217;t gorge; don&#8217;t be boisterous
or quarrelsome at table; don&#8217;t stare
at your neighbor or his plate; don&#8217;t
criticise the food; don&#8217;t pick your teeth
with your knife&mdash;such, with others still
more elementary, are the maxims which
meet us in this period, in Latin and
French, in English, German, and Italian,
but regularly in verse. Now and then
there is a further touch of the age: scrape
bones with your knife but don&#8217;t gnaw
them; when you have done with them, put
them in a bowl or on the floor!</p>

<p>If the correspondence of mediaeval
students were preserved for us in casual
and unaffected detail, nothing could give
a more vivid picture of university conditions.
Unfortunately in some respects
for us, the Middle Ages were a period of
forms and types in letter-writing as in
other things; and for most men the writing
of a letter was less an expression of
individual feeling and experience than it
was the laborious copying of a letter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
some one else, altered where necessary to
suit the new conditions. And if something
fresh or individual was produced,
there was small chance of preserving it,
since it was on that account all the less
likely to be useful to a future letter-writer&mdash;&#8220;so
careful of the type, so careless
of the single&#8221; letter, history seems.
The result is that the hundreds of student
letters which have reached us in the manuscripts
of the Middle Ages have come
down through the medium of collections
of forms or complete letter-writers, shorn
of most of their individuality but for that
very reason reflecting the more faithfully
the fundamental and universal phases of
university life.</p>

<p>By far the largest element in the correspondence
of mediaeval students consists
of requests for money; &#8220;a student&#8217;s
first song is a demand for money,&#8221; says a
weary father in an Italian letter-writer,
&#8220;and there will never be a letter which
does not ask for cash.&#8221; How to secure
this fundamental necessity of student<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
life was doubtless one of the most important
problems that confronted the
mediaeval scholar, and many were the
models which the rhetoricians placed before
him in proof of the practical advantages
of their art. The letters are generally
addressed to parents, sometimes to
brothers, uncles, or ecclesiastical patrons;
a much copied exercise contained twenty-two
different methods of approaching an
archdeacon on this ever-delicate subject.
Commonly the student announces that
he is at such and such a centre of learning,
well and happy but in desperate need of
money for books and other necessary expenses.
Here is a specimen from Oxford,
somewhat more individual than the average
and written in uncommonly bad
Latin:</p>

<p>&#8220;B. to his venerable master A., greeting.
This is to inform you that I am
studying at Oxford with the greatest
diligence, but the matter of money stands
greatly in the way of my promotion, as
it is now two months since I spent the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
of what you sent me. The city is expensive
and makes many demands; I
have to rent lodgings, buy necessaries,
and provide for many other things which
I cannot now specify. Wherefore I respectfully
beg your paternity that by the
promptings of divine pity you may assist
me, so that I may be able to complete
what I have well begun. For you must
know that without Ceres and Bacchus
Apollo grows cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>If the father was close-fisted, there
were special reasons to be urged: the
town was dear&mdash;as university towns
always are!&mdash;the price of living was exceptionally
high owing to a hard winter,
a siege, a failure of crops, or an unusual
number of scholars; the last messenger
had been robbed or had absconded with
the money; the son could borrow no more
of his fellows or of the Jews; and so on.
The student&#8217;s woes are depicted in moving
language, with many appeals to
paternal vanity and affection. At Bologna
we hear of the terrible mud through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
which the youth must beg his way from
door to door, crying, &#8220;O good masters,&#8221;
and coming home empty-handed. In an
Austrian formulary a scholar writes from
the lowest depths of prison, where the
bread is hard and moldy, the drink water
mixed with tears, the darkness so dense
that it can actually be felt. Another lies
on straw with no covering, goes without
shoes or shirt, and eats he will not say what&mdash;a
tale designed to be addressed to a
sister and to bring in response a hundred
<i>sous tournois</i>, two pairs of sheets, and
ten ells of fine cloth, all sent without her
husband&#8217;s knowledge. &#8220;We have made
little glosses, we owe money,&#8221; is the terse
summary of two students at Chartres.</p>

<p>To such requests the proper answer
was, of course, an affectionate letter,
commending the young man&#8217;s industry
and studious habits and remitting the desired
amount. Sometimes the student
is cautioned to moderate his expenses&mdash;he
might have got on longer with what he
had, he should remember the needs of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
sisters, he ought to be supporting his
parents instead of trying to extort
money from them, etc. One father&mdash;who
quotes Horace!&mdash;excuses himself
because of the failure of his vineyards. It
often happened, too, that the father or
uncle has heard bad reports of the student,
who must then be prepared to deny
indignantly all such aspersions as the
unfounded fabrications of his enemies.
Here is an example of paternal reproof
taken from an interesting collection relating
to Franche-Comt&eacute;:</p>

<p>&#8220;To his son G. residing at Orleans P.
of Besan&ccedil;on sends greetings with paternal
zeal. It is written, &#8216;He also that is
slothful in his work is brother to him that
is a great waster.&#8217; I have recently discovered
that you live dissolutely and
slothfully, preferring license to restraint
and play to work and strumming a guitar
while the others are at their studies,
whence it happens that you have read but
one volume of law while your more industrious
companions have read several.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
Wherefore I have decided to exhort you
herewith to repent utterly of your dissolute
and careless ways, that you may no
longer be called a waster and your shame
may be turned to good repute.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the models of Ponce de Provence
we find a teacher writing to a student&#8217;s
father that while the young man is doing
well in his studies, he is just a trifle wild
and would be helped by judicious admonition.
Naturally the master does not
wish it known that the information came
through him, so the father writes his son:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have learned&mdash;not from your
master, although he ought not to hide
such things from me, but from a certain
trustworthy source&mdash;that you do not
study in your room or act in the schools
as a good student should, but play and
wander about, disobedient to your master
and indulging in sport and in certain
other dishonorable practices which I do
not now care to explain by letter.&#8221; Then
follow the customary exhortations to
reform.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>Two boys at Orleans thus describe
their arrival at this centre of learning:</p>

<p>&#8220;To their dear and respected parents
M. Martre, knight, and M. his wife, M.
and S. their sons send greeting and filial
obedience. This is to inform you that, by
divine mercy, we are living in good health
in the city of Orleans and are devoting
ourselves wholly to study, mindful of the
words of Cato, &#8216;To know anything is
praiseworthy.&#8217; We occupy a good dwelling,
next door but one to the schools and
market-place, so that we can go to school
every day without wetting our feet. We
have also good companions in the house
with us, well advanced in their studies
and of excellent habits&mdash;an advantage
which we well appreciate, for as the
Psalmist says, &#8216;With an upright man
thou wilt show thyself upright.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Such youths were slow to quit academic
life. Again and again they ask permission
to have their term of study extended;
war might break out, parents or brothers
die, an inheritance have to be divided,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
but the student pleads always for delay.
He desires to &#8220;serve longer in the camp
of Pallas;&#8221; in any event he cannot leave
before Easter, as his masters have just
begun important courses of lectures. A
scholar is called home from Siena to
marry a lady of many attractions; he answers
that he deems it foolish to desert
the cause of learning for the sake of a
woman, &#8220;for one may always get a wife,
but science once lost can never be recovered.&#8221;</p>

<p>The time to leave, however, must come
at last, and then the great problem is
money for the expenses of commencement,
or, as it was then called, inception.
Thus a student at Paris asks a friend to
explain to his father, &#8220;since the simplicity
of the lay mind does not understand such
things,&#8221; how at length after much study
nothing but lack of money for the inception
banquet stands in the way of his
graduation. From Orleans D. Boterel
writes to his dear relatives at Tours that
he is laboring over his last volume of law<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
and on its completion will be able to pass
to his licentiate provided they send him
a hundred <i>livres</i> for the necessary expenses.
An account of the inception at
Bologna was quoted in the preceding
chapter.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Unlike the student letters, which range
over the whole of the later Middle Ages,
mediaeval student poetry, or rather the
best of it, is limited to a comparatively
short period comprised roughly within the
years 1125 and 1225, and is closely connected
with the classical phase of the
twelfth-century renaissance. It is largely
the work of the wandering clerks of the
period&mdash;students, ex-students, professors
even&mdash;moving from town to town
in search of learning and still more of adventure,
nominally clerks but leading
often very unclerical lives. &#8220;Far from
their homes,&#8221; says Symonds, &#8220;without
responsibilities, light of purse and light of
heart, careless and pleasure-seeking, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
ran a free, disreputable course.&#8221; &#8220;They
are wont,&#8221; writes a monk of the twelfth
century, &#8220;to roam about the world and
visit all its cities, till much learning makes
them mad; for in Paris they seek liberal
arts, in Orleans classics, at Salerno medicine,
at Toledo magic, but nowhere manners
and morals.&#8221; Their chief habitat,
however, was northern France, the center
of the new literary renaissance.</p>

<p>Possibly from some obscure allusion to
Goliath the Philistine, these wandering
clerks took the name Goliardi and their
verse is generally known as Goliardic poetry.
This literature is for the most
part anonymous, though recent research
has individualized certain writers of the
group, notably a Master Hugh, canon of
Orleans, ca. 1142, styled the Primate, and
the so-called Archpoet. The Primate,
mordant, diabolically clever, thoroughly
disreputable, became famous for generations
as &#8220;an admirable improviser, who if
he had but turned his heart to the love of
God would have had a great place in divine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
letters and have proved most useful
to God&#8217;s church.&#8221; The Archpoet is found
chiefly in Italy from 1161 to 1165, going
&#8220;on his own&#8221; in spring and summer but
when autumn comes on turning to beg
shirt and cloak from his patron, the archbishop
of Cologne. Ordered to compose
an epic for the emperor in a week, he replies
he cannot write on an empty stomach&mdash;the
quality of his verse depends on the
quality of his wine:</p>

<p class="center">Tales versus facio quale vinum bibo.</p>

<p>Good wine he must at times have found,
for he composed the masterpiece of the
whole school, the Confession of a Goliard,
that unforgettable description of the
burning temptations of Pavia which contains
the famous glorification of the joys
of the tavern:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">In the public house to die</div>
<div class="indent">Is my resolution;</div>
<div class="verse">Let wine to my lips be nigh</div>
<div class="indent">At life&#8217;s dissolution;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
<div class="verse">That will make the angels cry,</div>
<div class="indent">With glad elocution,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Grant this toper, God on high,</div>
<div class="indent">Grace and absolution!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Though written in Latin, the Goliardic
verse has abandoned the ancient metrical
system for the rhyme and accent of modern
poetry, but even the best of modern
versions, such as those of John Addington
Symonds, from which I am quoting, fail
to render the swing, the lilt, the rhythmical
flow of the original. Its authors
are familiar with classical mythology and
especially with the writings of Ovid,
whose precepts, copied even in severe
Cluny, were freely followed. Most of
all is this poetry classical in its frankly
pagan view of life. Its gods are Venus
and Bacchus, also Decius, the god of dice.
Love and wine and spring, life on the
open road and under the blue sky, these
are the common subjects; the spirit is
that of an intense delight in the world that
is, a joy in mere living, such as one finds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
in the Greek and Roman poets or in that
sonorous song of a later age which the
academic world still cherishes,</p>

<p class="center">Gaudeamus igitur iuvenes dum sumus.</p>

<p>In general the Goliardic poetry is of an
impersonal sort, giving us few details
from any particular place, but reflecting
the gayer, more jovial, less reputable side
of the life of mediaeval clerks. The worshipful
order of vagrants is described,
open to men of every condition and every
clime, with its rules which are no rules,
late-risers, gamesters, roysterers, proud
that none of its members has more than
one coat to his back, begging their way

<div class="verse">No one there dreads death&#8217;s invasion,</div>
<div class="verse">But all drink in emulation.</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>Then they sacrilegiously drink once for
all prisoners and captives, three times for
the living, a fourth time for the whole
body of Christians, a fifth for those departed
in the faith, and so on to the thirteenth
for those who travel by land or
water, and a final and unlimited potation
for king and Pope. Such poetry is plainly
the expression of a &#8216;wet&#8217; age.</p>

<p>Often bibulous and erotic, the Goliardic
verse contains a large amount of
parody and satire. Appealing to a public
familiar with scripture and liturgy, its
authors parody anything&mdash;the Bible,
hymns to the Virgin, the canon of the
mass, as in the &#8220;Drinkers&#8217; Mass&#8221; and
the &#8220;Office for Gamblers.&#8221; One of the
best-known pieces is a satire on the Papacy
under the caption of &#8220;The Gospel
according to Mark-s of silver.&#8221; This is
only one of many bitter attacks on Rome,
while the pride, hardness, and greed of the
higher clergy are portrayed in &#8220;Golias
the Bishop.&#8221; The point of view in general
is that of the lower clergy, especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
the looser, wandering, undisciplined element
which frequented the schools and the
roads, the <i>jongleurs</i> of the clerical world,
familiar subjects of ecclesiastical legislation
since the ninth century.</p>

<p>Poetry of this sort is so contrary to
conventional conceptions of the Middle
Ages that some writers have denied its
mediaeval character. &#8220;It is,&#8221; says one,
&#8220;mediaeval only in the chronological
sense,&#8221; while others find in it close affinities
with the spirit of the Renaissance or
of the Reformation. It would be more
consonant with the spirit of history to
enlarge our ideas of the Middle Ages so
as to correspond to the facts of mediaeval
life. The Goliardi were neither humanists
before the Renaissance nor reformers
before the Reformation; they were simply
men of the Middle Ages who wrote for
their own time. If the writings of these
northern and chiefly French clerks seem
to anticipate the Italian Renaissance, it
may be that the Renaissance began earlier
and was less specifically Italian than has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
been supposed. If the authors are more
secular, even more earthy, than we should
expect clerks to be, we must learn to expect
something different. In lyric poetry,
as in the epic and the drama, we are now
learning more of the close interpenetration
of the lay and ecclesiastical worlds,
no longer separated by the air-tight partitions
which the imagination of a later day
interposed. And whether their spirit was
lay or ecclesiastical, the Goliardi were certainly
human; they saw and felt life
keenly, and they wrote of what they knew.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is time to redress the balance with a
word about a less obtrusive element, the
good student. &#8220;The life of the virtuous
student,&#8221; says Dean Rashdall, &#8220;has no
annals,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and in all ages he has been less
conspicuous than his more dashing fellows.
Thus the ideal scholar of the sermons
is a bit colorless but obedient, respectful,
eager to learn, assiduous at
lectures, and bold in debate, pondering his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
lessons even during his evening promenades
by the river. The ideal student of
the manuals is he who practices their precepts.
The typical student of the letters
has already described himself as devoted
wholly to study, though somewhat short
of money. The good student of the poems&mdash;there
is no such person! Student
poetry was &#8220;not all bacchic or erotic or
profane,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> but much of it was, and we
must not look here for the more serious
side of academic life. Jean de Hauteville&#8217;s
account of the poor and industrious
scholar is representative of a large class of
students but not of a large body of poetry.
The good student&#8217;s occupations are best
reflected in the course of study, his assiduity
best seen in his note-books and disputations.
The documents which concern
the educational side of the university are
also a source for student life! It has been
observed that the alumni reunions of our
own day are often more prolific in recollections
of student escapades than of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
the daily performance of the allotted
task. The studious lad of today never
breaks into the headlines as such, and
no one has seen fit to produce a play
or a film &#8220;featuring the good student.&#8221;
Yet everyone familiar with contemporary
universities knows that the serious
student exists in large numbers,
and it has been shown conclusively that
the distinction he there achieves reflects
itself in his later life. So it was in the
Middle Ages. The law students of Bologna
insisted on their money&#8217;s worth of
teaching from their professors. The examinations
described by Robert de Sorbon
required serious preparation. Not
only was the vocational motive a strong
incentive to study in the mediaeval university,
but there was much enthusiasm
for knowledge and much discussion of intellectual
subjects. The greater universities,
at least, were intellectually very
much alive, with something of that &#8216;religion
of learning&#8217; which had earlier
called Abelard&#8217;s pupils into the wilderness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
there to build themselves huts that
they might feed upon his words. The
books of the age were in large measure
written by its professors, and the students
had the advantage of seeing them in the
making and thus drinking of learning
at its fountain-head. Then as now, the
moral quality of a university depended
on the intensity and seriousness of its
intellectual life.</p>

<p>If we consider the body of student literature
as a whole, its most striking, and
its most disappointing, characteristic is
its lack of individuality. The <i>Manuale
Scholarium</i> is written for the use of all
scholars who propose to attend universities
of students. The letters are made
as general as possible in order to fit the
need of any student who wants money,
clothes, or books. Even the poems, where
we have some right to expect personal expression
of feeling, have the generic character
of most mediaeval poetry; they are
for the most part the voice of a class, not
of individuals.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>At the same time it must be remembered
that this characteristic of the student
productions, if it robs them of something
of their interest, increases their
historical value. The historian deals
with the general rather than the particular,
and his knowledge must be
built up by a painful collection and
comparison of individual facts, which
are often too few or too unlike to
admit of sound generalization. In the
case of these student records, however,
that labor has already been performed
for him; in the form in which they
come down to us they have lost, at the
hands of the students themselves, what
is local and peculiar and exceptional, and
have become, what in view of the nature
of our information no historian could
hope to make them, the generalized experience
of centuries of student life.</p>

<p>It is this broadly human quality that
gives the productions of the mediaeval
student a special interest for the world of
today. In substance, though not in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
form, many of them are almost as representative
of modern Harvard or Yale as
of mediaeval Oxford or Paris. The
Latin dialogue and disputation, the mud
of Bologna, and the money-changers of
the Grand-Pont, belong plainly in the
Middle Ages and not in our time; but
money and clothing, rooms, teachers, and
books, good cheer and good fellowship,
have been subjects of interest at all times
and all places. A professor of history
once said that the greatest difficulty of
historical teaching lay in convincing
pupils that the events of the past did not
all happen in the moon. The Middle
Ages are very far away, farther from us
in some respects than is classical antiquity,
and it is very hard to realize that
men and women, then and now, are after
all much the same human beings. We
need constantly to be reminded that the
fundamental factors in man&#8217;s development
remain much the same from age to
age and must so remain as long as human
nature and physical environment continue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
what they have been. In his relations to
life and learning the mediaeval student
resembled his modern successor far more
than is often supposed. If his environment
was different, his problems were
much the same; if his morals were perhaps
worse, his ambition was as active,
his rivalries as intense, his desire for learning
quite as keen. And for him as for
us, intellectual achievement meant membership
in that city of letters not made
with hands, &#8220;the ancient and universal
company of scholars.&#8221;</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The standard work on mediaeval universities
is Hastings Rashdall, <i>The Universities of Europe
in the Middle Ages</i> (Oxford, 1895; new
edition in preparation), to which my indebtedness
will be apparent throughout. The later
literature can be most easily found in L. J.
Paetow, <i>Guide to the Study of Mediaeval History</i>
(Berkeley, 1917). Important materials
are conveniently accessible in translation in
D. C. Munro, <i>The Mediaeval Student</i> (Philadelphia,
1895); and A. O. Norton, <i>Readings
in the History of Education: Mediaeval Universities</i>
(Cambridge, Mass., 1909). Bologna
now has a cartulary and a special series of
<i>Stud&icirc; e Memorie</i> (both since 1907); while the
municipal history of the early period has been
studied by A. Hessel, <i>Geschichte der Stadt Bologna
von 1116 bis 1280</i> (Berlin, 1910). Light
has recently been thrown on Salerno by the
studies of Giacosa and Sudhoff and the dissertations
of Sudhoff&#8217;s pupils; its most popular
product, <i>The School of Salernum</i>, can be read<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
in the quaint English version of Sir John Harrington,
recently reprinted (London, 1922)
with a good note by F. H. Garrison and a less
valuable preface by Francis R. Packard.
Paris still lacks a modern historian; Mullinger
is still the standard work on Cambridge; while
Oxford can best be studied in Rashdall, supplemented,
as in the case of Cambridge, by the
histories of the several colleges.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The most useful general work on the content
of mediaeval learning is Henry Osborn Taylor,
<i>The Mediaeval Mind</i> (third edition, New York,
1919). This may be supplemented by R. L.
Poole, <i>Illustrations of the History of Mediaeval
Thought and Learning</i> (second edition,
London, 1920); M. Grabmann, <i>Geschichte der
scholastischen Methode</i> (Freiburg, 1909-11);
Sir J. E. Sandys, <i>History of Classical Scholarship</i>,
I (third edition, Cambridge, 1921); Lynn
Thorndike, <i>History of Magic and Experimental
Science</i> (New York, 1923); Pierre Duhem,
<i>Le syst&egrave;me du monde de Platon &agrave; Copernic</i>, II-V
(Paris, 1914-17); Charles H. Haskins,
<i>Studies in the History of Mediaeval Science</i> (in
press, Harvard University Press); the standard
histories of philosophy, mathematics, law,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
and medicine; and the more special literature
in Paetow&#8217;s <i>Guide</i>, including his own study of
the <i>Arts Course</i> (Urbana, 1910) and his edition
of the <i>Battle of the Seven Arts</i> (Berkeley,
1914). For a sample of Abelard&#8217;s <i>Sic et Non</i>,
see Norton, <i>Readings</i>, pp. 20-25. Abelard&#8217;s
method can be followed further in the logical
writings edited for the first time by B. Geyer
in Baeumker&#8217;s <i>Beitr&auml;ge zur Geschichte der
Philosophie des Mittelalters</i>, XXI (M&uuml;nster,
1919 ff.). The best account of the class-rooms
of a mediaeval university is F. Cavazza, <i>Le
scuole dell&#8217;antico studio bolognese</i> (Milan,
1896). Robert de Sorbon&#8217;s <i>De conscientia</i> is
edited by Chambon (Paris, 1903).</p>

<p>Brief sketches of student life will be found
in the last chapter of Rashdall and in the little
volume of R. S. Rait, <i>Life in the Mediaeval
University</i> (Cambridge, 1912). In the text
I have drawn freely from an article of my own
on student letters (<i>American Historical Review</i>,
III, pp. 203-229) and from one on the
Paris sermons (<i>ib.</i>, X, pp. 1-27). John of
Garlande&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i> will be found most conveniently
in T. Wright, <i>A Volume of Vocabularies</i>
(London, 1882), pp. 120-138; he also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
wrote a <i>Morale Scolarium</i> of which Paetow is
preparing an edition. The <i>Manuale Scholarium</i>
has been translated and annotated by R.
F. Seybolt (Harvard University Press, 1921).
<i>Statuta vel Precepta Scolarium</i> have been
edited by M. Weingart (Metten, 1894) and by
P. Bahlmann in <i>Mitteilungen der Gesellschaft
f&uuml;r deutsche Erziehungs- und Schulgeschichte</i>,
III, pp. 129-145 (1893). The latest discussion
of mediaeval manuals of manners
is by S. Glixelli, in <i>Romania</i>, XLVII,
pp. 1-40 (1921). The best single collection of
Goliardic verse is J. A. Schmeller, <i>Carmina
Burana</i> (Breslau, 1894); the best translations
are those of J. A. Symonds, <i>Wine, Women, and
Song</i>. Two poets have since been individualized,
the Primate by L&eacute;opold Delisle and W.
Meyer, the Archpoet by B. Schmeidler and M.
Manitius. For an introduction to the vast literature
of Goliardic poetry, see Paetow&#8217;s
<i>Guide</i>, pp. 449 f.; P. S. Allen, in <i>Modern Philology</i>,
V, VI; and H. S&uuml;ssmilch, <i>Lateinische
Vagantenpoesie</i> (Leipzig, 1917). On the
origin of the word &#8216;Goliardi,&#8217; see James Westfall
Thompson, in the <i>Studies in Philology</i>,
published by the University of North Carolina,
XX, pp. 83-98 (1923).</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
